--------------------------- MODULE BlockerPending ---------------------------
(***************************************************************************
One file F and its inline-blocker record over a session (#4484): which
blockers F's bytes hold, what each post-write dispatch observes, what the
delta calls new, and what the record, the tool result, the commit gate and
the turn-end Resolved line then say.

Findings: "a" and "b" are blockers a fast (inline) runner reports; "d" is a
blocker a collect-later runner reports (Deferred). A finding's id is the one
the delta keys on (dispatcher.ts `filterDelta(..., d => d.id)`):
 - a line-bound id (an LSP id, `lsp:<code>:<line>`,
   clients/dispatch/utils/lsp-diagnostics.ts) is <<finding, line offset>>, so
   a line inserted above it gives it a new id;
 - an ordinal id (Ordinal; helm-lint's `helm-lint-<ordinal>-<level>`,
   clients/dispatch/runners/helm-lint.ts) is its rank in the observation, so
   fixing an earlier finding renumbers the later one onto the fixed one's id.

Actions, each a hook step of the code:
 - Write(new, shift, touched): an authored write/edit and its tool_result
   pipeline, run to the record verb (runtime-tool-result.ts: runPipeline,
   dispatchLintWithResult, recordInlineBlockers or clearInlineBlockers,
   updateGitGuardStatus). `new` is the blocker set of the new bytes, `shift`
   inserts a line above every finding, `touched` the findings on lines the
   write changed (ctx.modifiedRanges). The record verb's ordering under
   parallel writes is dispatch-pipeline's model (InlineFix); here writes are
   sequential;
 - Opaque(new): an unauthored write (an opaque bash recovery, #3226) that
   introduces nothing; its run withholds the blocker channel, so it may only
   keep or clear the record (clearInlineBlockers' `analysis.authored = false`);
 - Settle: the collect-later run of the current bytes settles and its
   blocking finding joins the record (deferred-runner-blockers.ts,
   recordDeferredInlineBlockers), at the commit gate or the turn end's late
   lane, whichever asks first;
 - TurnEnd(settle): handleTurnEnd. The late lane may or may not find the
   deferred run settled; the replay lists the record as Unresolved, and the
   Resolved line names F when a clear noted it and nothing is Unresolved
   (runtime-turn.ts `formatResolvedLine`, held while F is still listed). The
   record carries into the next turn.

Switches:
 - ClearOnCurrent (the #4484 fix, pinned TRUE): the record, the clean text
   and the clear read the current blocking set, the observation's blockers
   whether or not the delta calls them new. FALSE is the code before #4484:
   they read the delta's blockers, so an empty delta clears;
 - OpaqueKeep (the #4484 fix, part 2, pinned TRUE): an unauthored run clears
   the record only when it observes no blocker (clearInlineBlockers'
   `analysis.blocking`). FALSE is the code before #4484: it cleared on any
   new bytes;
 - Delta: FALSE is `--no-delta` (the causal differential);
 - RangeGated: finding "a" comes from a runner whose edit-range gate
   withholds blocking matches on lines the write did not change (tree-sitter,
   the ast-grep runners; `spanOverlapsModifiedRanges`). The delivered
   observation then does not show "a" on an untouched line;
 - MayFail: a fast run, an unauthored run or a settling collect-later run may
   reach no verdict (a timeout, a server error, an unanswered wait). Its
   findings are absent and it shows nothing gone;
 - Unused: finding "u" is an unused value. It blocks only while the delta
   calls it new (dispatcher.ts `promoteDeltaUnusedToBlockers`); held back as
   already seen it is still observed, as a warning.

The round-2 fix switches (#4484 round 2, each pinned TRUE). A recorded
blocker leaves the record only when a conclusive observation from its own
source shows it gone. FALSE is the round-1 code, where the record was the
delivered blocking set:
 - ScopeDeliveryOnly: an edit-range gate decides delivery only. A recorded
   blocker the gate withheld stays in the record (`outOfEditScope`,
   `DispatchResult.stillObserved`); one never recorded does not enter it;
 - CarryInconclusive: a recorded blocker whose runner reached no verdict on
   the write stays (`reachedNoVerdict`, `DispatchResult.inconclusiveSources`);
 - CarryDeferred: a recorded collect-later blocker stays while its re-check is
   in flight, and a settled conclusive run of the current bytes that no
   longer observes it retires it (`retireUnobservedRunnerBlockers`), noting
   F Resolved when the record empties;
 - CarryPromoted: a recorded promoted unused value stays while the run still
   observes it, held back as already seen.

The round-3 environment and fix switches (#4484 round 3; PR #4491's state
table, rules R1 to R4). Each fix switch is pinned TRUE:
 - Twin (environment): finding "p" is a second occurrence of "a"'s rule with
   "a"'s identity, already in F's bytes at the start and never delivered
   unless a write changes its line. It is range-gated like "a";
 - MaySkip (environment): a fast run may skip without reading the bytes (a
   size or line cap, an aborted WASM runtime, an unavailable grammar or
   server);
 - CarryByPosition (R2, R3): a recorded blocker is kept by an observation of
   its identity at its own aligned line only. FALSE is the round-2 code: the
   carry matched by identity alone and kept the observed copy, so a withheld
   "p" stood in for a fixed "a" (retainRecordedFindings);
 - SkipNoVerdict (R1): a skip without a stated not-applicable reason reaches
   no verdict (`reachedNoVerdict`). FALSE is the round-2 code: such a skip
   was a conclusive, empty observation;
 - OwedRanges (R4): the lines a write with no verdict covered stay owed, and
   they join the next run's range (`DispatchContext.owedRanges`). FALSE is
   the round-2 code: the next run withheld a blocker first written then.

The round-4 environment and fix switches (#4484 round 4; PR #4491's round-4
state table). The fix switch is pinned TRUE:
 - MayUnalign (environment): a write may have no line alignment to the
   bytes the record is about (an edit past the 1000-edit cap, a record with
   no anchor, bytes past the 2 MiB or 100000-line caps). It matters only
   when lines moved (`shift`): otherwise a recorded line is still right;
 - UnalignedIdentity (round 4): with no alignment a recorded blocker matches
   its identity anywhere, so a withheld "a" stays and a withheld "p" may
   stand in for a fixed "a" (a false block; the record keeps the observed
   copy). FALSE is the round-3 code: it read the recorded line number as it
   was, found nothing there, and retired a withheld "a" still in the bytes
   (verify probes P11c, P11d, P18).

The round-5 environment and fix switches (#4484 round 5; PR #4491's round-5
state table). Each fix switch is pinned TRUE:
 - TwinSameText (environment): "p"'s line has "a"'s text, so no line-content
   evidence tells them apart (#4481). FALSE is a twin with other text (P22);
 - UnalignedText (round 5, K1): a match by identity anywhere also needs the
   recorded entry's own line text (`Diagnostic.lineHash`), so a "p" with other
   text never stands in. FALSE is the round-4 code: identity alone, so a
   pre-existing "p" took over a fixed "a" and pinned (verify probe P22);
 - StaleAnywhere (round 5): an entry a write with no alignment kept without a
   match (its runner had no verdict) has no position afterwards (`unpos`); a
   later aligned write matches it anywhere by identity and text. FALSE is the
   round-4 code: the later write aligned its stale line number, found nothing
   there, and retired it while the bytes still held it;
 - OwedByContent (round 5, K2): without a positional alignment (no record, or
   a write with no alignment) a runner is owed the lines whose text matches an
   owed line. FALSE is the round-4 code: it was owed the whole file, so a
   pre-existing "p" no write had reached became a new STOP (verify probe P23).

The round-6 environment and fix switches (#4484 round 6; PR #4491's round-6
rows). Each fix switch is pinned TRUE:
 - GateB (environment): the range-gated runner may skip because a primary
   answers for the file (napi's Gate B, `covered-by-primary`, outcome
   "cover"). The primary's own gate sees only the lines the write edited
   (not the runner's owed lines), and its copy has another identity, so it
   neither delivers nor keeps a recorded "a" or "p" outside the edit;
 - EditScopedKeep (round 6, N1): that verdict covers only the edit, so a
   recorded gated blocker outside it stays (`editScopedVerdict`,
   `DispatchResult.editScopedRunnerIds`, carryRecordedBlockers). FALSE is the
   round-5 code: the skip retired it while the bytes still held it (verify
   probe P27);
 - EditScopedOwed (round 6): the runner stays owed its earlier lines outside
   the edit (owedRangesAfterDispatch). FALSE discharges them, so a blocker
   first written while it had no verdict never reaches its range again.

The round-7 fix switches (#4484 round 7; PR #4491's round-7 rows), each
pinned TRUE. They need no new environment: a Gate B skip may meet a silent
covering lane (outcome "silent", under GateB and MayFail), and a collect-
later Gate B skip may settle (under GateB and Deferred):
 - LaneVoids (O2): a covered skip whose lane (the `lsp` runner, the
   `ast-grep` server) gave no answer is no verdict (`coveredBy`, the
   dispatcher's void). FALSE is the round-6 code: the edit-scoped verdict
   stood, so a recorded blocker on an edited line retired while the bytes
   still held it (verify probe P33);
 - SettleCoverKeep (O1): a settled covered skip retires nothing
   (`retireSettledRunnerBlockers`). FALSE is the round-6 code: it retired
   a recorded collect-later blocker the skip never saw (verify probe P34).

The #4509 fix switch, pinned TRUE:
 - RecordedRuns: the gated runner skips as covered only while the record
   holds none of its blockers (`DispatchContext.recordedRunnerIds`); else it
   runs, and its own verdict judges its record. A settle of d is then never a
   covered skip while d is recorded. FALSE is the code before #4509: a failed
   write kept an entry whose line it edited with no position (P42), and the
   edit-scoped keep, which never shows an unplaced entry inside the edit,
   kept it after its fix for the session (`ConclusiveRetires`).

Invariants:
 - GateHonest: the commit gate is open only when no completed observation of
   the current bytes holds a blocker;
 - CleanHonest: a write's tool result says clean only when its observation
   holds no blocker;
 - ResolvedHonest: F is reported resolved only when the run that cleared
   the record observed every blocker it held gone (the ghost `clearOk`): a
   conclusive inline run of bytes without the inline ones, and a settled
   conclusive collect-later run of the current bytes without d. A write
   never observes d (its re-check is in flight), so a write that clears a
   recorded d is never honest about it;
 - GateSound: the gate is open only when the bytes hold no fast blocker
   outside the lines a run with no verdict still owes (the variable `owe`):
   stronger than GateHonest, it also catches a blocker a runner withholds or
   misreads. With MayFail and MaySkip FALSE nothing is ever owed;
 - RecordedReported: the record holds only findings some run delivered (the
   ghost `reported`): no observation stands in for a recorded blocker, except
   one a write with no alignment matched by identity (the ghost `held`, the
   fail-closed cost);
 - UnalignedKept: a write with no alignment never retires a recorded blocker
   its bytes still hold (the ghost `lost`);
 - TwinNotAdopted: a pre-existing twin with other text is never delivered or
   stood in by a write that did not reach its line (its line edited or owed)
   (the ghost `adopted`). A same-text twin is the #4481 residual;
 - RecordedKept: every blocker a run delivered stays in the record until a
   conclusive observation from its own source shows it gone (the ghost
   `owed`). It is the GateSound of a run that can fail or a value that blocks
   only when new: no write can block on a finding no run reported, so the
   property is about what was reported;
 - CleanSound: a write's tool result says clean only when nothing reported
   was still owed when it said so (the ghost `cleanOk`);
 - ConclusiveRetires (#4509): a write whose run reached a verdict never keeps
   a recorded blocker its bytes lack (the ghost `pinned`): no pin.
