-------------------------- MODULE CascadeDelivery --------------------------
(***************************************************************************
What the cascade tells the agent about the import neighbours of an edited
file, turn after turn (#4485, #4486, #4487): the in-lane compute
(clients/dispatch/integration.ts computeCascadeForFile), the outstanding
silent-push touches (clients/lsp/cascade-tier.ts), and the turn_end
render (clients/runtime-turn.ts handleTurnEnd) with the pending error
record (clients/cascade-format.ts).

One primary, a fixed set of neighbours, one cascade run per turn. Each
neighbour's server follows one publish model, chosen at Init from Models:
 - "Pull":    answers a request at once (pull diagnostics);
 - "CmdPull": push-only, but answers the typescript.tsserverRequest command
              (classic TypeScript); publishes only when its verdict changes
              or on a first open;
 - "Always":  publishes after every notify (pyright);
 - "Silent":  push-only with no command (lua); publishes only on a change
              or a first open, so silence can mean clean or "not yet".

Freshness is an epoch, not a clock: `epoch` counts the primary's edits, and
a cache entry stamped with the current epoch was published after the edit
the run is about (integration.ts `isPostEditObservation`, `ts > cascadeStart`).

Actions:
 - Edit: the primary's write and notify. Every neighbour's verdict may flip;
   an open neighbour owes a publish per its model.
 - Publish(n): an owed publish arrives (the client's per-file cache).
 - Compute: the run for this turn's write, every neighbour at once: the
   recently-clean skip, the passive snapshot, the touch per model and tier,
   the bounded in-lane wait, the degraded fallback, the delta.
 - LaterWrite: the primary is rewritten before turn_end, so the run is
   superseded and renders nothing (runtime-turn.ts `getFilesChangedSince`).
 - QuietWindow: optional; reconciles answered outstanding touches.
 - Expire(n): an outstanding touch ages out of the registry.
 - OutsideChange(n, k): the neighbour's file is written by something pi
   never saw (git checkout, an external editor or formatter; k = "write",
   whether or not its verdict flips) or deleted (k = "delete"), either
   between turns or between the compute's read and turn_end (#4495 round 3).
   The client's cached publish now predates the change.
 - TurnEnd: settle, peek the registry, render the run, the late answers,
   the unresolved and changed lines, and update the record.

Invariants:
 - NoCleanWithoutFreshObs: a neighbour of a delivered run the agent reads
   as clean (no error, no pending, no unresolved line) was observed clean
   after the edit.
 - NoErrWithoutFreshObs: an error shown as this turn's was observed after
   the edit.
 - PersistentReserved: an error the record holds, that no observation
   after the edit read clean, is shown again (as this turn's error, as a
   late answer, or as an unresolved line).
 - TouchEndsWithinBound: every touch the run sent ends answered or shown
   pending in the same turn.
 - AnswerWhenAskable: a neighbour whose server answers on request is
   answered, never left outstanding.
 - ExpiryKeepsAnswer: no answer that arrived for an outstanding touch is
   dropped unread when the touch expires.
 - NoUnresolvedAfterChange: the unresolved line never names a neighbour
   whose file changed after the observation its record holds (#4495 F1,
   round-2 verify R2-1).
 - NoSilentForget: a recorded error whose file was written outside pi is
   never forgotten without the "changed since checked" line (#4495 round-2
   verify R2-2); a deleted file's record may go silently.
 - TypeOK.

CONSTANTS
    Neighbours,         \* the import neighbours of the primary
    Models,             \* publish models the scenario allows (subset of the four)
    MaxTurns,           \* turns explored
    Expiry,             \* turns before an outstanding touch expires
    QuietFires,         \* the quiet window may run (it may also never run)
    TierPath,           \* "inLane"     CmdPull neighbours take the waits path (#707 sync confirm)
                        \*              and Silent ones a bounded wait (integration.ts
                        \*              SILENT_PUSH_WAIT_MS; cascade-tier.ts "command-pull")
                        \* "deferQuiet" tier-3 neighbours are touched and deferred to the
                        \*              quiet window (pre-#4485)
    PassiveGate,        \* "afterEdit"  a passive snapshot serves only if published after
                        \*              the cascade started (isPostEditObservation)
                        \* "ttl"        any snapshot younger than the TTL serves (pre-#4486)
    FallbackGate,       \* "afterEdit"  the touch-error and degraded fallbacks display only
                        \*              post-edit entries
                        \* "ttl"        they display any entry younger than the TTL
    RecentlyClean,      \* TRUE: a neighbour confirmed clean is skipped by later runs
                        \* (the recently-clean cache, pre-#4485)
    Delta,              \* "none"    every observed error is listed on every run
                        \* "rolling" an error listed on the previous run is hidden (pre-#4487)
    UnconfirmedMarker,  \* "marked" an unanswered neighbour is named on a pending line
                        \*          (CascadeRun.unconfirmed, the turn_end advisory)
                        \* "none"   it is dropped and the run can read clean
    ExpiryRead,         \* "peekLog" turn_end peeks the registry and an expiring touch
                        \*           is read before it is dropped (cascade-tier.ts
                        \*           peekOutstandingCascadeTouches, deliverResolvedOutcome)
                        \* "drop"    no peek; expiry drops the touch unread
    Reserve,            \* "record" a delivered error stays pending until observed
                        \*          clean, and turn_end renders it when not re-checked
                        \* "none"   no record (pre-#4487)
    PendingGate,        \* "notify" turn_end passes each record entry through the
                        \*          freshness gate against its read bound
                        \*          (runtime-turn.ts `pendingGate`); a written
                        \*          neighbour is named once "changed since checked"
                        \*          and forgotten, a deleted one forgotten silently
                        \* "drop"   both are forgotten silently (#4495 round 2)
                        \* "none"   the record renders whatever happened to the file
                        \*          (#4495 round 1)
    OutsidePhases,      \* when OutsideChange may fire: a subset of {"start"} (between
                        \* turns) and {"computed"} (between the compute's read and
                        \* turn_end); a config bound, not a fix switch
    OutsideKinds,       \* which outside changes: a subset of {"write", "delete"}
    CheckStamp          \* "read"     the record's stamp is the run's read bound
                        \*            (CascadeRun.checkedAt: the compute's start,
                        \*            or a late answer's touchedAt), so the gate
                        \*            sees any write after the read
                        \* "delivery" the stamp is turn_end's delivery time
                        \*            (#4495 round 2), so a write between the
                        \*            read and turn_end is invisible to the gate

\* the record holds, and in phase "computed" the observation this turn's run
\* made. A write after the record's delivery is visible to the gate under
