\* RG is the read guard, reads and authorship together (D5: authorship

\* LSP fleet. LT: the lens toggles (no model state). LZ: the lazy-tool
\* activations (#3604; D7: /tree keeps them). AD: the advisory queue, which
\* only /reload carries (S2, from the slot only).

\* master at df5fb8abb (2026-09-27), before #3669 and S1-S3. The read guard:
\* resetForSession on every primary session_start, so /reload resets it
\* (N1); the fork stash was an activation-closure `let`
\* (pendingForkReadGuard), which the fork's new activation could not see, so
\* /fork and /clone started clean; no session_tree handler. The lazy-tool memory was a
\* file-keyed in-process map, so pi --fork started without it (#3604). No
\* advisory crossed a start (the queue was untagged, see "advisoryScope").
\* The widget's fork start cleared it (#3589).

\* Merged master: S2 gave the lazy-tool memory a cell per scope (#3653); a

\* guard and turn counter are the primary's (#3607, N2, #3613 open).

\* ordered before pi-lens scheduled AgentSession.reload(), which pi does not
\* stop while it awaits the start's emit. One step: the start never adopts
\* (the code returns before adoptHandoff once its shutdown ran) and never
\* registers. Its shutdown saves no sidecar either way: the coordinator's
\* session id is not pinned yet (persistScope's hasStableSessionId gate).
\* Under "forwardUnadopted" it re-keys the slot left for the start to its
\* own /reload (forwardHandoff); without it, it stashes the empty scope.
\* Registry and LSP writers are out of scope for this step.
\* forwardHandoff's store filter: a store stays in the forwarded slot when
\* the interrupted start's reason k adopts it (the model's adopt rows are
\* every action but reset and none).

\* The design's NoCrossScopeWrite (#3528, #3568, #3596, #3576): a live

\* The design's NoLostCarry (shape 54): every fact that reached a cell of the
\* live scope's lineage, on an entry its conversation still holds, is in the
\* cell it reads.
NoLostCarry ==

\* The same over every read-guard write that COMPLETED, whether it reached a
\* cell or a guard dropped it: a read whose tool result is in the live

\* Hypothesis 3 (#3803): a slot is taken only by a start whose conversation

\* start adopts another session's state through the slot.
NoCrossSessionAdoption ==
    \A x \in taken : x.from \in lin[sess[x.by]]

\* #3540 case A, N3: a token drawn later outranks every earlier one, across

\* #2890: one session_start mutation pass per scope.
OneResetPerScope == \A t \in Tickets : resets[t] <= 1

\* A live scope's cell holds only facts of its own conversation lineage, on
\* its current branch (proposed in the S9 review). The invariants above take
\* `x.o \in lin[...]` as a premise, so a lineage truth that omits a scope
\* makes them vacuous for its facts: a /fork that does not copy its parent's
\* lineage passes every other invariant of Fix, and violates this one.

NoForeignActivation ==

\* #3604: a live scope holds every activation its conversation made
\* (/tree keeps them, D7; /new starts a conversation of its own). A demoted
\* real successor is a secondary, so the check covers every role.

\* #3748: an advisory reaches only a context call of its own conversation.
NoCrossSessionDelivery ==
    \A d \in advOut : d.o \in lin[sess[d.to]]

\* #3881 r2: an advisory reaches only a context call on its producer's
\* session file. Only /reload carries an advisory to a successor (AD's
\* policy), and /reload keeps the file, so a delivery across files crossed a
\* /fork, /clone or resume.
AdvisoryStaysInSession == \A d \in advOut : sess[d.o] = sess[d.to]

\* S2 (#3612): an advisory still queued when its scope retired by /reload is
\* not lost: once the successor started, it is queued again, and so is
\* later delivered, still queued, or dropped for another reason (a later
\* /new). One queued after its scope retired (late) is an accepted,
\* recorded drop.
