# Session lifecycle model

A TLA+ model of pi-lens' session-scoped stores across every pi session
transition. It began as slice S9 of the #3609 design (one session-scoped state
store) and is re-baselined (#3803, lane L1) on the merged slices: S1 (#3732,
scope tickets and the lineage handle), S3 (#3759, late writers fenced by the
captured scope) and S2 (#3777, the session hand-off), with #3757 (advisories
drained per scope) and #3668 (gap subagents kept off the primary slot). It is
the composition layer over the sibling models: content-level truth stays in
`formal/read-guard`, `formal/session-straddle`, `formal/format-drain` and
`formal/session-registry`. Every config states its expected verdict on its
first line (see `formal/file-locks/README.md`), and the `TLA+ models` CI job
(`node scripts/check-tla-models.mjs`) checks them all.

Four kinds of config:

- **Merged behaviour** (`Merged`, `MergedStores`, `H3FileBacked`) must pass,
  and so must #3819's fix (`H3FileLess`, `H3FileLessStores`,
  `H3FileLessCarry`, `H3StaleSlot`, `H3StaleSlotFileLess`, with `ticketKey`
  and `demotedDiscard`), and so must #3881's (`H3Interrupted`,
  `H3InterruptedFileLess`, with `forwardUnadopted` and `forwardPolicy`). The rest register a known violation of merged
  master until its fix flips the config to `pass`: `Current` violates
  `SecondaryIsolation` through N2 (#3613); the `H3Demote*` configs record the
  cost of #3668's row-17 residual (`NoLostCarry`, `NoLostAdvisory`,
  `NoLostActivation`).
- **Design** (`Fix`, `FixProcess`, `FixOrder`, `NewestReadTreeFork`) is the
  adopted #3609 design, S4 included (a subagent gets its own read guard and
  turn counter). It is not #3819's fix: with `FileLess = {}` and no subagent
  replacement, `Fix` cannot reach either #3819 path. The `AcceptedLateRead*`
  configs pin the false block the design accepts (F1).
- **Pre-fix** (`PreS1*`, `PreS2*`, `PreS3*`, `Pre3757*`, `Pre3819*`, `Pre3881*`) restores the shape a
  merged fix removed, and must violate the invariant that fix established.
- **Mut** configs remove one mechanism or restore one table row: older
  pre-fix shapes, today's open residuals, and design alternatives the design
  rejected. The "Pre-fix and Mut configs" table says which.

## What the model covers

**Store content is abstracted to facts.** A fact `[e, o]` says "scope `o`
recorded something about the tool result at conversation entry `e`". The read
guard (`RG`) is the fact store. `RG` conflates read records and authorship
(`recordWritten`). The two differ on `/tree` (authorship is reset there,
#3603), on fork (the `read-guard-authorship` store resets,
`clients/read-guard-branch.ts`), and in the branch filter: only the
read-set passes through `importBranch`, while authorship restores unfiltered
(`clients/read-guard-branch.ts`). Beside it:

- the turn counter (`TC`);
- the widget's write-order guard (`WG`), which lives in a `clients/` module
  and so survives an entry-module re-evaluation and a factory re-run;
- the LSP fleet (`LS`), fenced by the LSP service generation, one process
  counter since #3755;
- the registry entry (`RE`) and its re-registration intent;
- the lazy-tool activations (`LZ`, #3604): origin scopes, with no entry and no
  branch filter (`lazyToolMemoryStore`, `clients/tool-set-policy.ts`);
- the agent advisory queue (`AD`, #3757): one advisory per producer, tagged
  with the scope that queued it (`queueAgentAdvisory`,
  `clients/agent-nudge.ts`).

**Scopes.** Each activation gets a scope: a ticket drawn from one process
counter (S1, `clients/session-scope.ts`), with a role (primary or
secondary), a session file and a branch epoch. A handle is current while its
scope is live and, at branch level, while its branch epoch is unchanged. That
is the only identity. The module-level `runtime` is modelled as `last`, the
scope the most recent primary `session_start` served.

**Host transitions** (pi 0.85.1):

| Transition | Modelled as |
|---|---|
| `/new`, resume, `/fork`, `/clone` | `session_shutdown`, then the new activation's `session_start`. Shutdown and start are separate steps, so a writer can land between them. `/fork` copies the branch without its last entry; `/clone` copies all of it. pi sends reason `fork` for `/clone`. `session_before_fork` is an action with no effect under the merged mechanisms (S2 deleted pi-lens' handler); it carries only the pre-S2 slot. |
| `/reload` | The same, on the same file. The start may re-evaluate the entry module (jiti fallback), which restarts a per-evaluation order turn (N3). |
| cancelled fork | Another extension cancels after `session_before_fork` (I3). |
| quit, `pi --fork` | Quit ends the process, and in-flight work dies with it. `pi --fork` then starts a new process whose only channel is the parent's sidecar. |
| `/tree` | The same activation. The branch loses its last entry and the scope's branch epoch bumps (`moveBranch`, from `retainBranch`). |
| LSP idle reset | pi-lens' own timer. It resets the LSP service only. |
| subagent start/stop | An in-process subagent binds with reason `startup` while the primary is live, or in its replacement gap, where #3668 declines it. It skips `handleSessionStart` (#473), begins its own scope (`beginScope` in the `session_start` handler, `index.ts`) and never adopts. |
| subagent `/reload`, `/fork` | Its own replacement. Its shutdown takes the secondary path (no stash). With no primary registered (the primary's replacement gap), its start is the successor by #3668's rule (a reason other than `startup`), so it classifies primary and adopts; the primary's real successor is then demoted to a secondary (`BeginDemoted`). This is #3668's stated residual, row 17. |
| duplicate start | A second `session_start` for the same replacement (I5, #2890). |
| interrupted start | `Interrupt` (#3881): the replacement's primary start begins (its scope's ticket is drawn, the module-level runtime serves it), and before `adoptHandoff` the activation's own `/reload` shutdown lands, because a handler ordered before pi-lens scheduled `AgentSession.reload()` and pi does not stop it while it awaits the start's emit. One step, once per behaviour. The start never adopts or registers, and the shutdown saves no sidecar (the coordinator's session id is not pinned yet, so `persistScope` does not run). Not combined with registry or LSP writers. |

**The hand-off (S2).** `stashHandoff` (`clients/session-scope.ts`)
replaces the one process slot at a primary shutdown whose successor reads it:
`/reload` (key: `reload` and the session's own file) and `/fork` or `/clone`
(key: `fork` and pi's `targetSessionFile`). `/new`, resume and quit leave the
slot as it is. A file-less session keys on `undefined`
(`clients/session-scope.ts`; the model's `FileLess` constant).
`takeHandoff` (`clients/session-scope.ts`) is called only by a primary
fork or reload start; it takes the slot on an equal key and leaves an
unmatched slot in place with no expiry (`clients/session-scope.ts`). A
start's source is fixed by its reason (`SOURCES`,
`clients/session-scope.ts`): a fork reads the slot, else the parent's
sidecar; a reload the slot, else its own sidecar; a resume and a launch their
own sidecar, else the parent's; `/new` nothing. The first source that exists
wins for every store (`adoptHandoff`, `clients/session-scope.ts`).

**The sidecar is abstracted.** The model saves a scope's sidecar at every
primary shutdown. The code saves it at `turn_end` and at a `/reload` or
`/fork` shutdown that left a slot (`persistScope` in the `session_shutdown` handler, `index.ts`). The two differ only for a
write that lands after the last `turn_end` and before a `/new`, resume or quit
shutdown: the `agent_settled` drain's authorship credit, which every start
but `/reload` resets anyway (`clients/read-guard-branch.ts`).

**Writers.** Each writer begins once in a live scope and lands at any later
step. pi refuses `/tree` and `/reload` while streaming, but `agent_settled`
handlers run after the run is marked inactive (I1), and bounded handlers are
abandoned without being cancelled (I2). This over-approximation hides nothing
the host allows.

- `read`: a primary read-guard write after an await: a late read producer or
  `recordWritten` in `handleToolResult` (`clients/runtime-tool-result.ts`),
  a bridge replay (`clients/mutation-bridge.ts`), or the `agent_settled`
  drain's credit. S3 fences them all by the handle captured at hook entry
  (`entryCapture`); without it, the write resolves the module-level runtime
  when it lands, as `recordWritten` did before S3. The native read record of a
  non-bash tool is not a late writer: `handleToolResult` does not await before
  it (#3732's premise check).
- `secRead`: the same in a subagent.
- `heartbeat`: the registry heartbeat's repair.
- `lsp`: LSP work that can spawn a server (#3576), fenced by
  `captureLspServiceGeneration` (`clients/lsp/server.ts`).
- `widget`: a pipeline verdict write to the widget in the current turn.
- `advisory`: the `agent_end` drain's lost-edit notice, tagged with the
  drain's captured scope (#3757).
- `activate`: `pi_lens_activate_tools` in a live scope (`rememberLazyTools`,
  `index.ts`), atomic.

A `Context` action is a context call of a live scope (`consumeAgentNudge`,
`clients/agent-nudge.ts`): under #3757 it prunes the retired scopes'
advisories, each with a counted record, and takes its own.

**Which entry a read-guard writer holds** is the constant `LateHandlers`.
With `FALSE`, the writer holds its branch's newest entry: the tool result its
handler is processing. With `TRUE`, it holds any entry of its branch, because
its handler outlived a later entry. Every config uses `TRUE` except
`NewestReadTreeFork`, `AcceptedLateReadReload` and `AcceptedLateReadResume`.

**Policies are constants.** A config picks `TargetPolicy` (the merged table)
or `LegacyPolicy` (master at df5fb8abb, before #3669 and S1-S3), `TargetFence`
or `LegacyFence`, and `TargetSec` (the design, S4 included), `MergedSec`
(merged master) or `LegacySec`.

| Store | startup | /new | resume | /fork, /clone, pi --fork | /tree | /reload | shutdown | idle | Secondary: target / merged | Fence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RG` target | rehydrate | reset | rehydrate | import-parent | filter-by-branch (D8) | filter-by-branch (D5) | none | none | own / shared (#3613) | branch |
| `RG` legacy | rehydrate | reset | rehydrate | reset | none | reset (N1) | none | none | shared | session |
| `TC` | reset | reset | reset | reset | none | reset | none | none | own / shared (N2, #3613) | session |
| `WG` guards | reset | reset | reset | carry (legacy: reset, #3589) | carry | carry | none | none | shared | none |
| `LS` | none | none | none | none | none | none | reset | reset | shared | service |
| `LT` lens toggles | reset | reset | reset | reset | none | reset | none | none | shared | none |
| `LZ` activations | rehydrate | reset | rehydrate | import-parent (legacy `pi --fork`: reset, #3604) | none (D7) | carry | none | none | own / own (legacy: shared, #3653) | none |
| `AD` advisories | none | none | none | none | none | carry (slot only; legacy: none) | none | none | per scope (#3757) | none |

- The code's `StartAction` is `adopt | reset | none`; which source an `adopt`
  reads is fixed by the reason, and only the read-set is branch-filtered. The
  model's `rehydrate`, `import-parent`, `carry` and `filter-by-branch` are the
  `adopt` rows of that table.
- `LT` carries no model state.

**`FixParts` selects the mechanisms:**

- `entryCapture` (S3, D2): writers use the lineage handle captured at hook
  entry.
- `handoffAtShutdown` (S2, D3): the slot is written at `session_shutdown`,
  keyed by (start reason, successor file). Without it, the slot is written at
  `session_before_fork`, as #3669 shipped it (`stashForkHandoff`, pre-S2).
- `consumeOnMatch` (S2, F2): only a primary fork or reload start takes the
  slot, and only on an equal key; an unmatched slot stays. Without it, every
  start takes the slot and discards it when unmatched (design section 3.4 as
  written).
- `processOrderTurn` (S1, N3): the write-order turn is a process counter
  (`nextOrderTurn` in `clients/session-scope.ts`, drawn by `RuntimeCoordinator.beginTurn`).
- `dedupe`: the #2890 duplicate-start gate.
- `recordDrop` (S1, F1): a dropped read-guard write whose entry is still on
  its conversation's branch leaves a record (`recordDroppedRead`,
  `clients/session-scope.ts`).
- `advisoryScope` (#3757): a context call takes only its own scope's
  advisories, and a retired scope's are dropped with a record.
- `ticketKey` (#3819, option b): a file-less slot is keyed by the ticket of
  the scope that left it, bound to the session manager it left from
  (`stashHandoff`), and a start's key is the ticket bound to the manager pi
  hands it (`Carrier`). pi keeps the manager on `/reload` and on an
  in-memory `/fork`. Without it, a file-less key is `undefined`.
- `demotedDiscard` (#3819 r2): a demoted start (`BeginDemoted`) whose key
  matches the slot discards it without adopting (`discardHandoff`). No
  other start removes a slot except by taking it. Without it, the slot
  stays until a later start of the demoted session takes it.
- `forwardUnadopted` (#3881): the interrupted start's shutdown
  (`Interrupt`) re-keys the slot left for that start to its own `/reload`,
  written by the interrupted scope (`forwardHandoff`), and stashes nothing
  of the scope. Without it, it stashes the scope's empty snapshot, as
  `stashHandoff` did.
- `forwardPolicy` (#3881 r2): the forwarded slot keeps only the stores the
  interrupted start's own reason adopts (`Keeps`), so the successor's
  policy applies on top of the original one. Without it, every store is
  forwarded, and the inner `/reload`'s start carries a `/fork` start's
  advisory (AD: fork none, reload carry).

## Invariants

| Invariant | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NoCrossSessionState` | A live scope's read-guard cell holds only its own facts and the facts it inherited. The registry entry holds only live roots. Every LSP server belongs to the current service generation. |
| `NoStaleBranchWrite` | A live scope's own-lineage facts name entries on its current branch. |
| `NoLostCarry` | Every fact that reached a cell in the live scope's conversation lineage, on an entry that conversation still holds, is in the cell the scope reads. |
| `NoFalseBlock` | The same, over every read-guard write that completed, whether it landed or a guard dropped it. The design violates it (F1, accepted), so only `AcceptedLateRead*` and `NewestReadTreeFork` check it. |
| `NoUnrecordedFalseBlock` | `NoFalseBlock` over the writes that left no drop record: every false block is recorded. |
| `NoOwnDrop` | No guard drops a write whose own lineage is still current (catalog shape 54). |
| `SecondaryIsolation` | A primary transition never removes a live subagent's own facts, and a subagent's turn never moves the primary's turn. |
| `HandoffOnce` | Every slot take is by a primary start that replaced the scope that wrote the slot. |
| `NoCrossSessionAdoption` | Every slot take is by a start whose conversation continues the writer's (the same file on `/reload`, a copy on `/fork`), so no start adopts another session's state through the slot (#3803 hypothesis 3). |
| `OrderMonotone` | A write-order token drawn later outranks every earlier one, across `/reload` and entry-module evaluations. |
| `OneResetPerScope` | One `session_start` mutation pass per scope. |
| `NoForeignFact` | A live scope's cell holds only facts of its own conversation lineage, on its current branch. |
| `NoForeignActivation` | A live scope holds only activations of its own conversation lineage. |
| `NoLostActivation` | A live scope, primary or secondary, holds every activation its conversation made (`/tree` keeps them, D7). |
| `NoCrossSessionDelivery` | An advisory reaches only a context call of its own conversation lineage. |
| `NoLostAdvisory` | An advisory still queued when its scope retired by `/reload` is queued again once the successor started. One queued after its scope retired is an accepted, recorded drop. |
| `AdvisoryStaysInSession` | An advisory reaches only a context call on its producer's session file. Only `/reload` carries an advisory, and `/reload` keeps the file, so a delivery across files crossed a `/fork`, `/clone` or resume (#3881 r2). Checked by the `Interrupt` configs. |

The conversation lineage the invariants check is per file (`lin`), and
`/fork`, `/clone` and `pi --fork` copy it. It is the truth, and it is
independent of the policy under test, so a `reset` policy cannot hide the loss
it causes.

## Bounds

A pass holds only inside these bounds:

- **Each transition kind happens at most once per behaviour**, and at most
  `MaxSteps` transitions happen (3 in `Fix`, `Merged` and `MergedStores`).
- **One `/new` target.** `/new` always creates file `N`, which is why the
  once-per-kind bound is load-bearing for `/new`: a second `/new` onto the
  same file `N` would be a model artifact, not host behaviour.
- **`/tree` only on a two-entry branch**, and it drops the last entry.
- **One writer of each kind** begins per behaviour, one advisory per producer,
  and one activation per scope. `MaxTurns` is 0 in `Merged`, 1 in `Fix` and
  `Current`, and 3 in `FixOrder`.
- **One subagent** (file `S`, its fork `T`), no time, and tool-call ids unique
  across conversations (D4 is not modelled).

## Results

TLC 2.19 (`tla2tools.jar` v1.7.4), one TLC worker per config, through

## Pre-fix and Mut configs and their issues

Provenance: "master" is today's code (open, or an accepted residual);
"pre-X" is code before fix X landed, named by the commit it models; "design
alternative" is a shape the adopted design rejects, never shipped.

| Config | Issue | Provenance | Shortest counterexample |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Pre3819FileLess` | #3819 | pre-#3819 (560f24ff5): the file-less key `(reason, undefined)` (`clients/session-scope.ts`) and #3668's row 17 (`clients/session-lifecycle.ts`: with no primary registered, only a `startup` start is declined) | The primary's `/reload` shutdown stashes `(reload, undefined)`; a subagent starts in the gap and is declined; the subagent's own `/reload` start classifies primary and takes the primary's slot. `/fork` fails the same way. |
| `Pre3819StaleSlot` | #3819 (review S1 on #3835) | pre-#3819 (560f24ff5): `stashHandoff` returns early for `/new` and resume (their `SOURCES` hold no slot), so the slot survives them, and `takeHandoff` has no expiry | The primary's `/reload` stashes `(reload, A)`; a subagent starts and is declined; the subagent's own `/fork` classifies primary (row 17) and does not match; the real successor is demoted; the new primary's `/new` (or resume) keeps the slot; the demoted session's own `/reload` classifies primary and takes scope 1's slot. Same conversation, so `NoCrossSessionAdoption` holds. |
| `H3DemoteCarry` | #3855 (#3668 row 17) | master: `classifySessionStart` in `clients/session-lifecycle.ts` declines only `startup` starts in the gap | A read lands; the primary's `/reload`; a subagent's own `/reload` or `/fork` classifies primary; the real successor is demoted and adopts nothing. |
| `H3DemoteAdvisory` | #3855 (#3668 row 17) | master, as `H3DemoteCarry` | An advisory is queued; `/reload`; row 17 demotes the real successor; a context call prunes the advisory as its retired scope's. |
| `H3DemoteActivation` | #3855 (#3668 row 17) | master: a secondary's scope never stashes, saves a sidecar or adopts, and `adoptHandoff` runs only for a primary start | The subagent activates a tool, and its own `/fork` starts without it. The same invariant catches row 17's demoted real successor without the primary's activations (113 states in the #3835 r1 review), after a longer trace. |
| `Current` | N2, #3613 | master: `onTurnStart` calls `runtime.beginTurn()` with no role gate (`index.ts`) | The subagent starts, and its `turn_start` moves the primary's turn. |
| `PreS1OrderTurn` | N3; #3540 case A | pre-S1 (b456ff89c): `_writeOrderTurn += 1`, a coordinator field | A turn draws token 1, `/reload` re-evaluates the entry, and the next turn draws token 1 again. |
| `MutWidgetDropAfterReEval` | N3's harm; #3540 | pre-S1 (b456ff89c), as above | Two turns and a widget write at token 2; after `/reload` with re-evaluation, a turn draws token 1, and the widget guard drops the live session's own write as older. |

## Findings

**F1. A dropped late read is a false block, and the design accepts it.** A
write whose handle is not current is dropped, and when the live conversation
still holds the dropped write's tool result, the next edit of that file is a
false block. `/reload` and resume are the exposure for a handler still
processing the newest tool result (`AcceptedLateReadReload`,
`AcceptedLateReadResume`). `/tree` and `/fork` lose a read only when its
handler outlived a later entry (`AcceptedLateReadTree`,
`AcceptedLateReadFork`; `NewestReadTreeFork` passes). Decision (2026-09-30,
A + C): the drop stays and leaves one bounded record with the retirement
reason (`recordDrop`, `recordDroppedRead`), checked by
`NoUnrecordedFalseBlock`. The late writers are the ones S3 fenced; the native
read record of a non-bash tool is not late (#3732's premise check).

**F2. A subagent's start must not consume the hand-off.** Design section 3.4
had every start take the slot and discard it when unmatched
(`MutSecondaryTakesHandoff`). Decision (2026-09-30): consume only on a match
and leave an unmatched slot (`consumeOnMatch`). In the code a subagent's
start never calls `takeHandoff` at all.

**F3. #3668's row 17 opens the slot to the wrong start (#3819).** A
subagent's own `/reload` or `/fork` in the primary's replacement gap
classifies primary. Three consequences follow.

- *Cross-session adoption, file-less only.* With the code's key, that start
  cannot take a file-backed primary's slot, because the files differ
  (`H3FileBacked` passes; making `SlotMatch` ignore the file reds it). A
  file-less session keys on `undefined`, so it takes the primary's slot
  (`H3FileLess`). The branch filter keeps foreign reads out (`NoForeignFact`
  holds, since tool-call ids differ), but activations and advisories cross,
  and authorship restores without the filter. A file-less primary's own
  chain of transitions stays safe: each fork or reload start is preceded by
  its own shutdown's stash. For adoption across sessions it does not matter
  whether `Begin` keeps an unmatched slot or whether `/new` clears it: the
  take happens in the gap, before the real successor starts.
- *A stale take, file-backed too.* The unmatched slot is not harmless.
  After row 17 demotes the real successor, `/new` keeps the slot, and the
  demoted session's own `/reload` later takes its predecessor's stale
  snapshot (`H3StaleSlot`, `HandoffOnce`). Clearing the slot at `/new`
  alone leaves the same path through the new primary's resume, while
  clearing it at every primary start after the take attempt (the audit's
  option (a)) closes it: `H3StaleSlot` passes (2322 states in the #3835 r1
  review). Keying a file-less slot by ticket alone does not close it (the
  #3835 review ran #3819's ticket-key model at five steps). So "file-backed sessions are protected" holds for
  adoption across sessions only. #3819's fix pairs the ticket key with
  `demotedDiscard` rather than option (a): (a) also destroys a legitimate
  slot when a row-17 gap primary quits inside the gap, so the real successor
  classifies primary and finds nothing (the #3868 r1 review's F1). The
  model cannot reach that cell, because it has one `pend`; a runtime witness
  pins it.
- *Loss.* The demoted real successor adopts nothing, so the conversation
  loses its reads and its queued advisory (`H3DemoteCarry`,
  `H3DemoteAdvisory`), and its activations (`H3DemoteActivation`, whose
  shortest trace is a subagent's own replacement, which never adopts). This
  is the cost of #3668's stated residual (#3855), whether sessions have
  files or not.

**F4. Today, a subagent's read authorises the primary's edit** (#3613). The
shared read guard puts a subagent's read in the primary's cell
(`MutSecondaryReadShared`, and `Current` without `SecondaryIsolation`).

**F5. An interrupted start's shutdown re-keys the slot; skipping the stash
is not enough (#3881).** The interrupted start never adopted, so the slot
left for it is the conversation's state. Model mutations of
`forwardUnadopted` on `H3Interrupted` / `H3InterruptedFileLess`:

- Leaving the slot as it is (no stash, no re-key) violates `HandoffOnce`
  file-backed (61 states: the inner reload's start takes a slot written by
  a scope it did not replace) and `NoLostActivation` file-less (363
  states: the inner reload's start finds no slot keyed by its manager's
  ticket).
- Re-keying without the interrupted scope as the writer violates the same
  two (61 and 363 states).
- Keeping the start's reason violates `NoLostActivation` (362 states): a
  `/fork` start's slot never matches the inner `/reload`'s start.
- Re-keying any slot rather than the one left for the start passes inside
  the bounds (no stale slot is reachable in three steps); the unit test
  `forwards the slot left for an interrupted start to that session's next
  start, and no other slot` pins it.
- Forwarding every store rather than the ones the start's own reason
  adopts (#3881 r1) violates `AdvisoryStaysInSession`
  (`MutInterruptedForkPolicy`): an interrupted `/fork` takes the parent's
  advisory under the `/reload` policy. Its authorship crosses the same way
  (`read-guard-authorship`: fork reset, reload adopt), but `RG` conflates
  authorship with reads, so the model cannot see that half; the runtime
  witness `gives a file-backed /fork interrupted by a reload none of the
  parent's authorship or advisories` pins it.

**Confirmations.** D3: `PreS2SnapshotAtBeforeFork` violates `NoLostCarry`.
D5: `PreS2ReloadReset` violates `NoLostCarry`. Carrying authorship on
`/reload` is required, not merely safe.

## Scope

Not modelled:

- **Content.** Staleness, FileTime, hashes and ranges are covered by
  `formal/read-guard`; the quiet window's tasks by `formal/session-straddle`;
  the drain by `formal/format-drain`; the registry lock and tail by
  `formal/session-registry`.
- **Authorship as a store of its own.** `RG` conflates it with reads (see
  above), so the model does not show authorship crossing under #3819.
- **S3's non-read-guard writers** (turn-state ranges, the turn summary, the
  git-guard latch, the debounce re-entry) and the fail-open external bridge
  producer (#3763); the deferral queue's two-hop credit (#3705). `svc` is
  one process counter, which is the merged behaviour (#3755).
- **The interrupted start's own continuation (#3881).** When another
  extension's `session_shutdown` handler awaits, pi has not yet invalidated
  the interrupted start's ctx, so that start runs on after its shutdown;
  the code returns before `adoptHandoff` once its shutdown ran. `Interrupt`
  is one step, so the model never reaches that continuation; the runtime
  witnesses' "the start runs on" axis pins it
  (`tests/index-3521-fork-tree-witness.test.ts`). An interrupt between the
  slot take and the end of `adoptHandoff`'s synchronous restores (a
  microtask-driven reload) is not modelled either.
- **#3668's successor marker and its expiry.** A replacement whose successor
  never starts (row 15), and a `session_start` that crashed before its scope
  was set, are not modelled; either leaves an untaken slot that only a start
  without its own stash could adopt, as in #3819. Row 17 is modelled for a
  subagent's own `/reload` and `/fork` only: its own `/new` or resume in the
  gap also classifies primary and demotes the real successor (the
  `H3Demote*` loss), without taking the slot, and is not modelled.
- **`MutGenPerEval` (#3755).** A follow-up needs its own discriminator:
  in the #3835 review, `NoCrossSessionState` could not see a
  per-evaluation LSP generation (the mutant passed, 291 states), while
  `\A srv \in fleet : st[srv.o] = "live"` redded it (77 states) and held on
  the unmutated model (161).
- **`formal/session-straddle`** is not re-baselined here; its generation is
  still an equality counter bumped at `resetForSession`.
- **#3587** (a shutdown that meets this process's own registry lock skips
  the deregistration), and secondary registry roots.
- **The ALS hazard of D2**, **D4** (tool-call id reuse across branches), and
  **N5** (the turn summary and test-runner delivery after `/tree`).
- **The widget's write token.** `WidgetWrite` allows one write per turn, and
  its token is the bare order turn, so the guard's `>=` and `>` cannot be
  told apart, and neither can the fork row's `carry` and `reset`.
- **Time**, the cwd-changing resume's re-evaluation, the MCP host, the
  advisory cap, and more than one subagent.
