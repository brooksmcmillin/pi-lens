(*  - the agent: Read (with #3576 R1, its read-warm touch: a stamped LSP  *)
(*    sync of the bytes it read, runtime-tool-call.ts ~833, outside pi's    *)

(*    of the bytes it read (stamped: #3481 last-read-wins).                 *)
(*  - pi: `_runAgentPrompt`'s finally awaits `_emitAgentSettled`, which     *)
(*    clears `_isAgentRunActive` BEFORE awaiting the extension handlers     *)
(*    (agent-session.js ~347). The interactive main loop awaits             *)
(*    session.prompt, so its next prompt waits for the drain; an RPC prompt *)
(*    is `void session.prompt` (rpc-mode.js ~302) and a host that polls     *)
(*    isStreaming/waitForIdle does not wait (Overlap). `/new` runs from the *)
(*    editor's submit callback, so it runs while the drain runs; the drain  *)
(*    has no abort signal then.                                             *)
(*  - the drain handler (one file): the session capture and the claim       *)

(*    -> formatFile (formatters.ts ~2379): read contentBefore, spawn the    *)

(*    resyncLspFile(fileContent, fileReadStamp) (~820).                     *)
(*    FixQueue: the #3561 format hold (~588) is taken before contentBefore  *)
(*    and released when the phase settles, after the fileContent read.      *)
(*    The per-file wait is `bounded(..., 10 s)` (~607): on expiry the       *)
(*    handler requeues and moves on while the formatter child keeps         *)
(*    running (Orphan). FixQueueHold: the hold's release follows the phase, *)
(*    not the bound, so the child keeps the queue until it has written.     *)
(*    FixOrphanSync: once that child has exited, a fresh read of F is taken *)
(*    and later sent to the LSP (~614); the read and the send are separate  *)

(*    the LSP service is retired (resetLSPService), so the next touch opens *)
(*    a fresh document and a drain touch after it would spawn a server for  *)
(*    the next session (#3528 r1 F1). LspGen: the drain's sends run only    *)
(*    while its session is current. StartGen: nor does it start formatting  *)
(*    a file after that (the format worker's and the autofix loop's start   *)
(*    check): its write could not be synced to the next session's LSP.      *)
(*  - a retire of the LSP service WITHOUT a session bump (#3576):           *)
(*    session_shutdown or the idle reset. ServiceGen: the drain's sends     *)
(*    also check the service generation it captured (lsp-launch-            *)
(*    availability, bumped by every resetLSPService). HeldResync (R1): a    *)
(*    drain send whose session or service was replaced goes only to a live  *)
(*    document, from a fresh read of F, and never opens one.                *)

\* Invariants

TypeOK ==
    /\ file \in Content /\ applied \subseteq 1..Edits
    /\ qOwner \in {"none", "agent", "drain"}
    /\ hs \in {"none", "before", "spawn", "wait", "fc", "apply", "done"}
    /\ sp \in {"none", "start", "run", "exited", "oread", "osend"}
    /\ lspOpen \in BOOLEAN /\ retired \in BOOLEAN

\* The drain never overwrites an agent edit (pi docs/extensions.md ~1925).
NoLostEdit == applied \subseteq file.e

\* What the drain reports as its format (summary.changed, the "formatted"
\* notice, the publishFilesTouched `fixes` provenance, recordWritten) holds
\* no agent edit: before -> after is formatting only.
HonestFormatClaim == ~badClaim

\* Once everything is quiet, an open LSP document holds the bytes on disk. This
\* is also the no-drop direction of the stamp filter and of the session guard
\* on the drain's sends: a send dropped although it carried the newest read
\* leaves the LSP behind the disk. A retired service (after /new) has no open
\* document until its session's next touch.
Quiet == aop = "idle" /\ DrainIdle /\ sp = "none" /\ extS = "idle"
LspMatchesDisk == (Quiet /\ lspOpen) => lspC = file

\* An edit is admitted only after this session showed the agent F
\* (read-guard.ts header: "Read state from session 1 never authorises session 2").
NoBlindAllow == ~blind

\* Shape 22: a drain claimed in one session never writes the next
\* session's state (read guard, pending queue, project change log), and never
\* opens a document in its fresh LSP service (#3528 r1 F1). The #3576 R1
\* resync of a document the next session already holds, to the bytes on disk,
\* is not such a write: it opens nothing.
NoCrossSessionWrite == ~crossWrite /\ ~lspCross

\* #234, #3576: a drain never opens a document on an LSP service that was
\* retired since it started (session_shutdown, the idle reset): that open
\* spawns a server nobody asked for.
NoDrainRespawn == ~respawn

\* Shape 54, the generation guard's no-drop direction: a drain that is still
\* in the session it claimed in keeps every session write (recordWritten,
\* requeue).
NoOwnDrop == ~ownDrop
