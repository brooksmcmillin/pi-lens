\* No waiter hangs: a touch waiting on its client can always leave the wait
\* (its publish is cached, or the timeout is armed and nothing can still
\* arrive), whatever happened to that client.
WaitBounded ==
    \A i \in T : pc[i] = "wait" =>
        (pub[tg[i]] \/ TimeoutGuard(i) \/ (Live(tg[i]) /\ held[tg[i]]))

\* A crash-looping server is bounded: at most Trip-1 respawns follow an
\* early or mid-life death (no window ageing modelled).
BoundedCrashLoop == loopRespawns < Trip

\* The key's demonstratedReady claim is about the client now in the registry.
ReadyIsCurrent == ready => (readyGen = gen /\ registry # "empty")

\* The key's demonstratedCold verdict is about the client now in the registry,
\* or about the absence of one while none is registered.
ColdIsCurrent == cold => (registry = "empty" \/ coldGen = gen)

\* Eviction never takes a client out from under an in-flight touch.
NoEvictUnderLease == ~evictUnderLease
