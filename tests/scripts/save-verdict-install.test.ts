/**
 * #4999 R3-1: a FAILED install must reach the save-verdict row as a cause.
 *
 * The driver (`scripts/probe-save-verdict.mjs`) wraps `ensureTool` in a
 * `try/catch`, and the round-2 case pinned that path with the string
 * `"install failed for clangd: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN"` — a throw the installer
 * does not produce. `ensureTool` answers `undefined` on every install failure it
 * owns (failed download, policy decline, held lock), so the catch never fired,
 * `row.failures` stayed empty, and the fixture was filed as
 * `server never spawned (no capability snapshot)`. On the 2026-10 run that line
 * covered nine fixtures a night with no way to tell an absent toolchain from a
 * failed download from a crashed server.
 *
 * These cases drive the REAL installer (`clients/installer/index.js`, the same
 * artifact the driver's `dist/` build comes from) with only the spawn boundary
 * mocked, and assert the exact cause line the driver records — so the guard is
 * proven against the failure mode it was written for, not against a fabricated
 * throw (#4999 R3-1; AGENTS shape 50).
 *
 * Limit, named: the driver itself is not spawned here, because it imports
 * `dist/`, which the Unit shards job does not build. The driver's install block
 * is one call to `installCauses` plus a join of its result, so the decision
 * under test is the one below.

 * into the row detail ONLY where the arms left the row unmeasured. Round 3
 * returned from `probeFixture` the moment `installCauses` reported anything, so
 * a fixture whose tool the installer does not manage — `gopls`, `csharp-ls`,
 * `fsautocomplete` record `declined: unknown tool id` while the runner's
 * toolchain still supplies the binary — was filed not measured. go, csharp and
 * fsharp regressed from measured to `install declined for …` in `tool-smoke` run
 * 40978934098 attempt 2 against 40971037638 (#4999 R4-1).
 *
 * The arms themselves cannot run here (they spawn a language server), so each
 * case supplies the state the arms leave — `cells` when they measured,
 * `undefined` when they did not — through the same `saveVerdictCells` the driver
 * calls, and asserts the row's verdict and detail.
