/**
 * #2556 — path containment over a `path.relative` result has one owner.
 *
 * `clients/path-utils.ts` owns containment: `relativeInside` (the lexical test),
 * `isUnderDir`, `isWithinForm` and `isWithinIdentity`. Every other containment test
 * is a copy of a rule that seam already owns (AGENTS.md shape 83), and the
 * copies are wrong in two measured ways:
 *
 * - **cross-drive (#4878 F1, HIGH):** `!rel.startsWith("..")` reads a
 *   `path.relative` result as "inside" whenever it does not begin with `..`.
 *   Across Windows drives `path.relative` returns an ABSOLUTE path, so a file
 *   on another drive reads as inside. `tests/support/vi-mock-export-gate.ts`
 *   shipped this and `Unit tests Windows` failed 26 cells on a head Linux CI
 *   and the local run called green.
 * - **`..`-name (#4835):** the prefix test reads a directory named `..foo`,
 *   which is INSIDE the root it belongs to, as outside.
 *
 * Neither shape has a tree-wide layer: `tests/config/path-identity-sweep.test.ts`
 * reads map keys and raw `realpath` calls, `path-key-fold-sweep` reads equality
 * folds, and `reported-path-attribution-sweep` deliberately drops a
 * `path.relative` result as a "fragment used for containment" (#4876 review r2
 * F5 records that blind spot). This ratchet is that layer, and the three stay
 * apart because each answers a different rule: a key, an equality, an
 * attribution, a containment. Folding them would make one detector depend on
 * another's needle vocabulary and would widen a frozen census instead of
 * governing the population it was built for.
 *
 * The detector is `tests/support/path-containment-scan.ts` and its own state
 * table is `tests/support/path-containment-scan.test.ts`; both parse the file,
 * so a comment is never code and a string is read only by its cooked value.
 *
 * KNOWN MISSED SHAPES (accepted floor — the needle cannot see them):
 * - a `path.relative` result handed to another FUNCTION and tested there, when
 *   the callee is in another module (live population 2, both in
 *   `tests/support/`: `vi-mock-export-gate.ts#isProductionModulePath` and
 *   `module-instance-scan.ts#isBuildCompiled`, each already pairing
 *   `path.isAbsolute`). A call that carries BOTH the relative value and a `..`
 *   literal IS reported (the argument hand-off reading), so this row is the
 *   cross-module case only.
 * - a value stored on an object or array and read back later
 *   (`records[i].rel.startsWith("..")`), a reassigned `let`
 *   (`let rel = f(); rel = path.relative(a, b)`), a destructured read, or a
 *   `relative` callee re-exported from another module under another name.
 * - a parent-segment literal carried through an OBJECT field or a function
 *   argument chain (`rel.startsWith(markers.parent)`). Named constants, RegExp
 *   literals and `indexOf`/`includes`/`match`/`test` readings are NOT in this
 *   list: #4882 review F1 proved the enumerated-predicate cut blind to them,
 *   and the derived reading now reports each.
 * - a SAME-FILE helper that returns a `path.relative` result, tested at its
 *   call site (`const rel = inside(path, root); rel.startsWith("..")`). The
 *   value reading is per file and follows declarators, so a name bound inside
 *   a helper is caught (#4882 verify r3 measured a late-bound `lateRel`), but
 *   the call/return edge is not walked. Live population 0: no helper of that
 *   shape has its result meet a `..` test in the scanned trees (#4882 verify
 *   r3 N2 measured the population, and it is empty), so this is a declaration,
 *   not a gap with members.
 * - a character-index read with no `..` literal
 *   (`rel[0] === "." && rel[1] === "."`). The arm needs a parent-segment
 *   LITERAL and this spelling never writes one, so neither the literal walk
 *   nor a comparison sees it. Live population 0 (0 sites, #4882 verify r3 N3);
 *   `rel[0] + rel[1] === ".."` IS reported, because it spells the literal.
 * - a relative result read through a member chain whose method returns
 *   something unrelated (`rel.split("/").length`), which the fail-closed
 *   reading reports rather than drops.
 * - a `switch (rel) { case "..": }`, which is not a comparison node. Measured
 *   on the authoring head: no such switch over a relative result exists in the
 *   scanned trees, so the live population is 0.
 *
 * SCOPE (defect shape 80, one verdict per root a containment test can be
 * written in — the fixer contract's `Evidence` section names them): `clients/`,
 * `tools/`, `mcp/`, `index.ts`, `scripts/` (with `scripts/lib/` and
 * `scripts/hooks/`, `.ts` and `.mjs`), `tests/support/`, and `tests/` outside
 * `support/`. `tests/config/` is inside `tests/` and therefore scanned. The
 * only root left out is a fixture directory's own generated content, which is
 * data rather than a containment answer; its measured population is 0.
 *
 * POPULATION on the authoring head (measured, `PI_LENS_PRINT_PINS=1`): 43
 * sites — 42 baseline rows plus the seam's own admission. 25 of them sit in
 * the runtime trees the first cut scanned (24 rows + `isAtOrAboveHomeDir`),
 * 4 in `scripts/` and 13 in `tests/` outside `support/`, all four scripts/ and
 * eleven of the thirteen tests members measured by #4882 review F2; the other
 * two are the predicate half's widening (an `expect(…).toBe("../…")` and a
 * `toMatch(/^\.\./)` assertion), not new defects.
