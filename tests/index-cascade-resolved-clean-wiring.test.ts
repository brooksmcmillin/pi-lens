/**
 * #4487 wiring guard at the index.ts seam: the late clean answer for a
 * neighbour must clear that neighbour's pending cascade errors.
 *
 * Recurrence: a neighbour the agent fixed between turns, whose clean publish
 * arrived only after the cascade stopped waiting, kept its old errors on
 * every later turn_end's unresolved line. turn_end's peek and the quiet
 * window's reconcile hand that clean answer to whatever `onResolvedClean`
 * index.ts registered; the record forgets the entry only if index.ts wires
 * `forgetCascadePendingNeighbor` there. The cascade-tier tests drive their
 * own callback, so only an activated extension shows the wiring.
 *
 * Tier 2, inline-factory mode (#4937 L6): the extension runs in a real pi
 * session on THIS test graph's modules, so the cascade registries the case
 * seeds and reads below are the ones the extension's wiring writes to. On the
 * path load they would be a second copy and the assertion would see nothing.
