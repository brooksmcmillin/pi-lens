/**
 * #4698: a turn whose ONLY action is `lens_diagnostic_mark` must clear the
 * `--lens-guard` commit gate for the blocker it marked.
 *
 * The defect: turn end re-derives the commit-gate latch from the turn-end
 * disposition policy (`resyncGitGuardAfterInlinePolicy`, #3248) at the point
 * where a file's post-policy survivor set is final. A turn that writes no file
 * returns from `handleTurnEnd` long before that pass (`clients/runtime-turn.ts`,
 * the `files.length === 0` early return), so the mark took and the next prompt
 * showed no blocker, while the latch still counted the marked record and
 * `--lens-guard` named it back at the commit. Two surfaces judged one
 * disposition, and only one of them saw the mark.
 *
 * Tier 2 (#4632): the BUILT extension inside a real pi `AgentSession`, with the
 * host's own `fauxProvider` scripted at the provider boundary. Nothing here is
 * mocked — the blocker is a bundled rule's answer on a real file, the mark is
 * the real `lens_diagnostic_mark` tool, and the commit is a real `bash` call
 * whose gate answer is asserted from the tool result the MODEL received. The
 * turn-script pieces (one tool call per reply, the `echo` marker, the
 * `lens_diagnostic_mark` identity, the transcript readers) are shared with
 * `tests/index-4632-s4-tool-call-verdict.test.ts` through
 * `tests/support/pi-session-commit-gate.ts`; only the turn grouping is local.
 *
 * The commit verb carries a marker (`echo`) after a `;`: a blocked call never
 * reaches the shell, so the marker's ABSENCE is the observable that the tool
 * did not execute and its presence is the observable that it did. That keeps
 * the assertion true whether git refuses the commit or creates one, so the
 * case does not depend on the checkout it runs in.
