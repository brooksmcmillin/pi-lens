/**
 * #3576 (G5, maintainer addition): the session generation guard over the
 * interleavings fast-check's scheduler picks, instead of one replay per
 * interleaving.
 *
 * Recurrence this file prevents: the session-straddle defects of one day
 * (#3499, #3512, #3528, #3568, #3576), each a writer that captured its
 * session, awaited, and landed after the next session's `session_start`.
 * Each was caught by a replay of the interleaving it was written for; the
 * property below states the guard's contract for every interleaving of
 * session starts, session shutdowns and writer completions.
 *
 * Production chain: a REAL `RuntimeCoordinator` and the real writers whose
 * guard takes the captured handle as an argument:
 * - `appendCascadePromise` (#3512: the deferred cascade's admission, then its
 *   compute settles under the scheduler and the turn end's settle appends it);
 * - `deferRunnerFindings` (#3568: a collect-later runner's deferral into the
 *   turn-end store, whose compute also settles under the scheduler);
 * - `recordLspMutation` with a session on its context (#3576: the quickfix
 *   pass's bookkeeping into the change log, the read guard and turn state).
 * - the widget's write guard (#3540 r2: `recordDiagnostics` under the order
 *   token `runtime.nextWriteOrderToken()` draws when the writer is issued).
 *   The widget is not session-guarded: a `/reload` keeps it and its guard,
 *   `/new` clears both, and a stale write that lands after the clear stays
 *   (#3596). What the property pins is that a token drawn later always
 *   outranks one drawn earlier, across session resets.
 * A writer captures `runtime.captureSessionGeneration()` when it is issued,
 * awaits its work (a scheduled promise: the pipeline, the formatter, the code
 * action), then writes. `session_start` is the production pair that runs in
 * one tick (`resetPendingRunnerFindings`, then `runtime.resetForSession`,
 * `runtime-session.ts`), and `session_shutdown` is `resetLSPService`, which
 * retires the LSP service and leaves the runtime session alone.
 *
 * The oracle is the test's own: which session each writer was issued in comes
 * from the command log, never from the coordinator's generation.
 *
 * How to write one of these: `tests/support/scheduler-properties.md`.
