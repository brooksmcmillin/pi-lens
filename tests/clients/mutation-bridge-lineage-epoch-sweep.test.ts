/**
 * #3763 item 5 / #3824 S2 / #3937 — the mutation bridge's epoch/lineage
 * population.
 *
 * The bridge accepts a foreign `readGuardBranchEpoch` on an entry and resolves
 * it against the live read guard. A well-formed value ABOVE the live epoch is
 * ignored and recorded (never silently skipped), and the entry is then
 * fail-open: it is credited and queued at the current epoch. That direction is
 * safe only because a producer that can name an epoch also captured the
 * lineage that answers currency (the in-process settled sweep). The bridge
 * exposes no epoch to read, so a producer without a lineage cannot learn one;
 * a no-lineage entry carrying an epoch is therefore an invented value.
 *
 * This sweep pins that population: every construction site that can send an
 * epoch into the bridge must also send `lineage`. A future producer that sends
 * an epoch without a lineage reds here, at the construction site, before it can
 * reach the fail-open branch. The behavioural half — that the one real
 * producer's entry carries both — is pinned in
 * `tests/index-observed-sweep-no-read-guard.test.ts`. The producer runtime pin
 * is unchanged and remains the independent witness for released writers.
 *
 * ## #3937: the spread blind spot
 *
 * The first cut read the CALL-SITE object literal's field names. A producer
 * that forwards a previously built object through a spread
 * (`const hidden = { ...entry, readGuardBranchEpoch: 5 };
 * replayThroughMutationBridge({ ...hidden })`) never spells the field at the
 * call site, so it escaped the census entirely — the spelling-enumerator
 * defect shape (AGENTS.md 34). The #3824 follow-up quoted that fixture.
 *
 * This version folds bounded LOCAL provenance instead of matching spellings.
 * Each expression resolves to at most sixteen possible OUTPUTS, of which at
 * most fourteen are reachable (`absent` never coexists with `unknown`); the
 * profiles are deduped, never capped, so no alternative is dropped. An output
 * records whether an epoch is present, what the `lineage` field's VALUE is
 * known to be, and whether an unresolved part could add or overwrite census
 * keys. The runtime fence is value-based (`clients/mutation-bridge.ts`: the
 * entry is dropped only when `lineage !== undefined` and the guard refuses), so
 * the census asks the same question: `safe` requires a lineage value the fold
 * can prove is not `undefined`. A key that is present but nullable or built by
 * a call is INDETERMINATE, never `safe`, and never described as runtime-safe.
 * The verdict is taken per output, so a conditional's lineage arm cannot
 * launder its epoch-only sibling:
 *
 *   * an object-literal argument contributes its explicit keys (`pair`,
 *     shorthand, method, and a computed STRING-literal key — an unlisted
 *     spelling of the same explicit key), plus the keys of every spread;
 *   * ONLY a literal object written at the call site is folded. A bound object
 *     is OPAQUE: `const h = { … }` captures a heap object, and a later statement
 *     can reach that same object through a property value, an array slot, an
 *     assignment RHS, a conditional arm, a destructuring source, a nested call
 *     argument, or a bare alias (`const other = h`) and mutate it. The fold
 *     cannot enumerate those spellings (AGENTS.md 34 — the r4 single-spelling
 *     `const b = a` relation read every other carrier as SAFE), so it proves
 *     NOTHING about a binding, only about the literal at the call site;
 *   * `a ? b : c` unions both arms as separate outputs; `a && b` contributes
 *     its right operand only when `a` can be truthy, and nothing when `a` is
 *     falsy, because a falsy operand spreads no keys; `a || b` / `a ?? b`
 *     union both operands;
 *   * a parameter, an import, a call result, a cross-file name, a computed key
 *     with a template substitution, or a string/template literal carrying an
 *     escape this fold does not decode is UNRESOLVED. `Object.assign(…)` is a
 *     call result and is UNRESOLVED too: folding it would fold the object it
 *     mutates and returns, which is the same opaque binding by another name.
 *
 * The lineage value is folded beside its presence, because presence alone is
 * the r2 false-safe: `undefined` / `void 0` is not a lineage, a non-`undefined`
 * literal or a constructor is, and **anything else** — a name, a call, a member
 * read, a parameter, an import, `null` — is MAYBE: present but unproven, hence
 * indeterminate beside an epoch. The fold does not resolve TypeScript types, so
 * no annotation is proof (not even the owned `LineageHandle`): a named type that
 * includes `undefined` behind an alias, a generic, an import, or a local shadow
 * is indistinguishable from the owned interface by spelling alone.
 *
 * The call population enumerates the callee spellings that rebind the bridge:
 * an import rename, a variable alias (`const r = replayThrough…`), a property
 * alias (`const r = mod.replayThrough…`), a destructured binding
 * (`const { replayThrough…: r } = mod`), a defaulted destructured binding
 * (`const { replayThrough…: r = mod.recordMutation } = mod`), a sequence callee
 * (`(0, mod.recordMutation)(…)`), and a subscript call
 * (`bridge["recordMutation"](…)`). A bridge callee silently absent from the
 * population is the F3 defect this round closes.
 *
 * An unresolved spread leaves the site INDETERMINATE, never falsely safe: the
 * forwarding might carry an epoch. The indeterminate set is registered below
 * with a checked reason and audited in BOTH directions (a new unresolved form
 * fails, and a stale admission fails) via `auditRegistry`. That is the honest
 * statement of coverage — the census proves the resolved population and names
 * the unresolved one; it does not assert whole-population completeness.
 *
 * Known limits, stated rather than papered over:
 *   * cross-file provenance is outside this static fold; a binding whose value
 *     is imported or built in another module resolves to indeterminate;
 *   * TypeScript type resolution is not attempted, deliberately: proving a
 *     named annotation non-nullable needs a type resolver this fold does not
 *     have. The value fold reads a literal, a constructor, or an explicit
 *     `undefined` written at the call site; a name, a call, a member read, a
 *     parameter, or an import is MAYBE, so
 *     a site that cannot prove its lineage value defined beside an epoch is
 *     INDETERMINATE — including the one production epoch sender (`index.ts`'s
 *     settled sweep). That producer's real value is pinned at runtime by
 *     `tests/index-observed-sweep-no-read-guard.test.ts`, and the producer plus
 *     the generic replay seam are registered below with their reasons;
 *   * a lineage VALUE named by a variable is NOT followed: `const lineage = 1`
 *     and `const { lineage } = entry` are the same spelling to a name-only
 *     fold, and a binding-declaration form it does not enumerate (a
 *     destructuring, `for…of`, or defaulted pattern) resolves the WRONG
 *     binding (the R5-1 finding, AGENTS.md 34). A name is MAYBE; only a
 *     literal, constructor, or explicit `undefined` at the call site decides;
 *   * a local function or class that shares a bridge callee's name is still
 *     counted as the bridge — a name collision this fold cannot resolve without
 *     type/module information. The approximation is LOUD: it can red a safe
 *     site, never pass an epoch-without-lineage site as safe. No production
 *     file declares one; a guard pins that population;
 *   * the call population is the lexical set `calleeName` decodes (a bare name,
 *     a member read, a string/identifier subscript, a sequence, and local
 *     aliases). A fully dynamic callee (`bridge[index](…)` with a computed
 *     `index`) is OUTSIDE it. `mightContainBridgeCallee` is only a lexical
 *     file-admission check — whether the text names a bridge callee at all —
 *     so a file can contain the plain name and still yield ZERO sites when
 *     every call spells the callee dynamically. The census makes no universal
 *     call-coverage claim.
