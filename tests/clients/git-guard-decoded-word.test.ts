// flake-shape: real-process-spawn — the oracle is real `bash -c`: whether bash runs `git commit` or `git push` for each spelling of the executable or the verb. A stubbed shell decodes nothing, and the rows exist because the matcher read token text that no shell reads (#4739).
/**
 * #4739: the `--lens-guard` commit gate reads the word bash decodes, run
 * against real bash.
 *
 * Recurrence: `$'git' push origin master` ran unguarded while `git push`,
 * `\git push` and `g""it push` were guarded, because the matcher read the
 * legacy token text (`$git`, with the `$` of the ANSI-C quote still in it).
 * Each hand-written spelling reds a different part of the word model, so the
 * rows are also generated, from the shared spelling generator (#4713 R11):
 * every quoting of the executable `git` before `push`, and of the verbs `push`
 * and `commit` after `git`.
 *
 * Each row runs through real `bash -c` with a recording stand-in for `git`
 * first on PATH (the real git never runs), then through
 * `isGitCommitOrPushAttempt`. A row passes when the gate guards exactly what
 * bash ran, or, for a row bash did not run, when it fails closed on a word the
 * model cannot read (see `ACCEPTED`).
 *
 * The fail-closed rule the table pins, in `hidesGuardedVerb`: a word the word
 * model cannot read (an expansion) may be any word. It
 * guards the command when it precedes a word that is, or may be, `commit` or
 * `push`, or a word that holds a guarded command (the unread word may be a
 * launcher's switch or `eval`), or when it is git's own verb. An ANSI-C word
 * is no such word: the model decodes it as bash does (round 5), and the
 * decode table below runs each escape class against real bash.
