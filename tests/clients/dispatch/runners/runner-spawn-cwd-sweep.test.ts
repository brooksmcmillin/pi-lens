/**
 * #2691 ratchet (AGENTS.md defect shape 40): a linter/formatter runner that
 * computes `ctx.cwd` for its availability probe and its config-detection
 * helper, then spawns the ACTUAL lint/analysis process without passing that
 * same `cwd`, so the child resolves project config (or, for psscriptanalyzer,
 * a settings file) against the extension host's `process.cwd()` instead of the
 * project being linted — while the runner's own `hasXConfig(ctx.cwd)` gate
 * says the project config was found.
 *
 * #1731 fixed this shape for sqlfluff BY SYMBOL and missed five more instances
 * that a shape-based sweep found while fixing #2691's reported yamllint case:
 * ruff, spellcheck/typos, psscriptanalyzer, oxlint and shellcheck. A
 * symbol-grep for the next tool name will miss the next instance the same way,
 * so this sweeps the SHAPE across every runner at once.
 *
 * ## What this file is, and what it is not
 *
 * The detection itself lives in `tests/support/spawn-cwd-scan.ts` and is
 * specified cell by cell in `tests/support/spawn-cwd-scan.test.ts` — one named
 * fixture per cell of PR #2693's "Detector state space (round 3)" table (call-
 * site kind × where a `cwd` token can sit). THIS file is the integration
 * assertion: it runs that scan over the live tree.
 *
 * The split is the round-3 lesson. Rounds 1 and 2 had only the live-tree run,
 * which can assert nothing about the cells today's tree does not occupy — so
 * round 1 shipped a detector that read argument one as the options object
 * (missing one of the six defects its own red block claimed to prove), and
 * round 2 shipped one that read a comment or a string value inside the braces
 * as a passed cwd, and whose wrapper rule never followed `helm-lint.ts`'s
 * `lintChart` or `helm-render.ts`'s `renderAndValidate`. Both went green here
 * the whole time.
 *
 * ## The two rules, in one line each
 *
 * A site conforms when the options literal has a PROPERTY NAMED `cwd`; a
 * same-file function is a spawn-routing wrapper when a spawn's `cwd` value
 * resolves to one of that function's OWN parameters, and then its CALLERS are
 * the sites checked. Both are answered off the real AST (`@ast-grep/napi`, the
 * same dependency `tests/support/availability-gate.ts` uses), never off text.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Direct children of `clients/dispatch/runners/` only, never `runners/utils/`:
 * several helpers there deliberately omit `cwd` for a genuine global-PATH
 * presence probe (`runner-helpers.ts`'s "3. Global PATH"
 * `safeSpawnAsync(toolName, ["--version"], { timeout: 3000 })`), a different
 * and legitimate shape from a runner spawning an analysis pass on a project
 * file. Widening into `utils/` needs its own exemption design rather than
 * borrowing this one.
 *
 ## What the scan cannot see, and what closes it here
 *
 * The scan recognises a spawn by the callee's simple name — `safeSpawnAsync(`
 * and `o.safeSpawnAsync(`. Three spellings therefore occupy NO site at all,
 * and because a site that is never counted also never moves the pinned
 * population, none of them would red anything on its own (round-4 R3-F2):
 *
 *   1. an ALIASED import — `import { safeSpawnAsync as spawn } from …`,
 *   2. `safeSpawnAsync.call(...)` / `.apply(...)`,
 *   3. `Reflect.apply(safeSpawnAsync, …)`.
 *
 * All three have zero occurrences today, and the last test in this file
 * ASSERTS that, so the bound is fail-safe rather than merely documented: the
 * first one written reds here, naming the file, instead of quietly becoming
 * an uncounted spawn. (A namespace import is already covered — `calleeName`
 * reads `ns.safeSpawnAsync(...)` through the member expression.)
 *
 * A call site that genuinely has no cwd to get wrong carries a single-line
 * `// cwd-exempt: <reason>` comment on the line DIRECTLY above the call (other
 * explanatory comments may sit above that; the tag line itself must be the one
 * immediately preceding), and the reason has to be a real one — a tag under
 * 15 characters of reason exempts nothing, which the scan decides so a fixture
 * can prove it. The sweep additionally fails on an exemption whose call site
 * now passes `cwd` anyway, so a stale exemption cannot rot in place.

 * quietly stops SEEING sites. Reverting `spawnPs` to positional arguments, or

/**

 * existing local wrappers" while `lintChart`, `renderAndValidate`,
 * `resolveVitePlusCommand` and `resolveBiomeFixKinds` all route a positional
 * cwd into a spawn and had their callers unchecked.
 *
 * `resolveVitePlusCommand` and `resolveBiomeFixKinds` were named in round 2's
 * own header as positional-cwd helpers that must NOT be followed; that
 * justification was wrong on its face — each puts its own `cwd` parameter into
 * a spawn's options literal, which is exactly what makes a wrapper — and both
 * are correctly followed now. The genuine non-wrappers are the probe closures
 * (`makeEslintProbe`, `probeCredo`, `makeClippyProbe`, `resolveCompiler`),
 * whose `cwd` is bound by an ANONYMOUS arrow that `createCwdCachedProbe`
 * invokes per call — no caller in the file supplies it, so there is no caller
 * to check.
