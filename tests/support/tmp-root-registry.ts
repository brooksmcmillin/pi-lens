/**
 * Per-worker registry of tmp roots the shared setup removes at file teardown
 * and on the worker's SIGTERM (#2912).
 *
 * Named recurrences, all measured on 2026-09-30 in the required Unit tests
 * job, each on a PR that did not touch the leaking file, each with "live
 * owners: none":
 *  - `pi-lens-sym-cpp-*` (tree-sitter-symbols, #3706): a registered root, the
 *    test timed out holding it, so its `finally { env.cleanup() }` had not run
 *    when the fork was killed;
 *  - `pi-lens-install-attempt-*` (#3705) and `pi-lens-tool-discovery-home-*`
 *    (#3699): raw roots the file DID remove, recreated afterwards by a deferred
 *    writer (measured: `probe-cache.json` + `probe-cache.json.locks` land in
 *    the removed home ~150 ms after `afterEach`).
 *
 * Nothing in the harness removed a root once its file ended: the hygiene owner
 * sweeps at the end of the RUN, after its assertion. Vitest SIGTERMs a fork
 * with no `exit` event, so no file-owned hook can be the last word either.
 *
 * Two kinds of root, two rules — the split is what keeps a genuine leak red:
 *  - `registered` (`setupTestEnvironment`): the harness OWNS this root's
 *    lifecycle, so it is removed whenever it still exists, whatever the test's
 *    outcome (timeout, failed assertion, kill).
 *  - `observed` (any other `pi-lens-*` `mkdtemp` directly under the real
 *    tmpdir): the FILE owns it. It is removed only when this worker saw the
 *    file remove it first and something recreated it afterwards (a straggler
 *    write). A root the file never removed is a forgotten cleanup and stays for
 *    the hygiene owner to red.
 * A directory made any other way (`mkdirSync`, a child process) is in neither
 * kind and is never touched.
 *
 * State lives on `globalThis`, not in this module: a test that calls
 * `vi.resetModules()` re-evaluates every module (AGENTS.md shape 25), and a
 * module-local Map would split the roots between the copy that recorded them
 * and the copy the setup sweeps. It is per PROCESS, so a worker can only ever
 * remove a root it created itself — never a sibling's live one.
