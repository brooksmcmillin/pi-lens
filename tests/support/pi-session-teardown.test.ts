/**
 * The tier-2 helper's drain pass joins registered deferred writers before the
 * fixture root is removed (#4937).
 *
 * Recurrence this prevents: master run 40967488612 (shard 2/5),
 * `tests/lens-toggle-command.test.ts` left `pi-lens-pi-session-yB7mpc` in the
 * shared tmp root. The loaded extension copy's worker snapshot write was still
 * in flight when the helper removed the root, and landed afterwards. A sweep
 * of the 45 tier-2 files at the same head found four more roots that came back
 * within 600 ms (the installer's debounced probe-cache flush in `index-4687`,
 * `index-4723` and `index-4732`; NDJSON rows in `context-append-to-last-user`).
 *
 * The real writers are covered across module copies in
 * `tests/clients/background-write-drains.test.ts`. This case pins the wiring
 * those depend on: the helper's own drain pass (`drainPiSessionWrites`, the
 * first step of its `afterAll`) runs the registry before the root is removed.
 * The writer here is a stand-in with the same shape as the installer's flush:
 * it writes into the root when its drain asks it to, and otherwise only when
 * the case lets it, after the removal. No timer decides the order.
