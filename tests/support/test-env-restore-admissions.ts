/**
 * #4589 admission reasons: WHY each baseline row is admitted.
 *
 * `test-env-restore-baseline.ts` says which writes are not provably restored.
 * This file says why, one entry per admitted file, and the sweep re-checks the
 * claim against the file's own source (`describe` mechanism rows in
 * `tests/config/test-env-restore-sweep.test.ts`). The split is AGENTS.md shape
 * 38: a baseline row needs a reason in a separate checked file, or a new leak
 * is admitted by appending one line.
 *
 * The mechanisms are the ways a file CAN restore a key without the detector
 * attributing it to the write:
 *
 * - `teardown`: the file declares `afterEach`/`afterAll` (or, for a
 *   `vi.stubEnv` row, `vi.unstubAllEnvs`), and the hook does not cover this
 *   write: it sits in a sibling `describe`, in a file-local helper called from
 *   tests, or in a loop whose iterable the file builds at run time;
 * - `finally`: the file puts the key back in a `finally`, but in another
 *   function than the write's;
 * - `helper`: the file returns a restore closure (or builds one with
 *   `withEnv`) that its caller must invoke;
 * - `module-pin`: a module-scope or `vi.hoisted` assignment set before a
 *   dynamic import, which no per-case hook can restore;
 * - `none`: nothing in the file restores this key. These rows are REAL leaks
 *   the ratchet holds until a fix restores them, and the check is falsifiable:
 *   a stub row needs no `vi.unstubAllEnvs` anywhere, and a plain write no
 *   hook, `finally`, or returned restore closure at all.
 *
 * A file's admitted mechanism must be one the sweep re-derives from its
 * source by the detector's own classifier (`envRestoreMechanisms`), so a
 * module-pinned write cannot be recorded as `teardown`.
