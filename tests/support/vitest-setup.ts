// #2042: per-file peak memory, for the files big enough to matter.

// Vitest's forks pool with `isolate: true` gives every test FILE its own child
// process (verified 2026-08-25: 20 files at `maxWorkers: 1` produced 20 distinct
// pids), so `process.resourceUsage().maxRSS` at the end of a file is that
// file's own peak, uncontaminated by its neighbours. Measured over all 740
// files of the default project: p50 93 MB, p90 389 MB, p99 1405 MB, max
// 2267 MB. The heavy tail is NATIVE memory — tree-sitter wasm grammar compiles
// and @ast-grep/napi arenas — which no V8 flag bounds and no reporter shows.
//
// What this record can and cannot say. It is an `afterAll` hook, so it only
// fires for a file that FINISHED. The file that was mid-run when the OS killed
// the job never reports its own peak. What the last lines before a kill name is
// the completed co-residents -- the memory profile of the phase the run died
// in, not the culprit. That is still far better than the nothing there was
// before, but it is circumstantial evidence, not attribution, and the
// `[mem-watch]` low-water mark is the record that says how close the run
// actually came.
//
// `maxRSS` is kilobytes on every platform: libuv normalizes the Win32 peak
// working set for `uv_getrusage`, so no per-platform scaling is needed.
