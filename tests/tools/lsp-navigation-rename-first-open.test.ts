// #3827: a real language-client stamp must reach the real rename capture, so
// this file spawns the fake LSP server through `launchLSP` and drives
// `lsp_navigation rename` against a real `createLSPClient`. Admitted to the

/**
 * #3827: `lsp_navigation`'s rename refused a valid rename when a file was
 * opened for the first time after the server computed the edit. A first
 * `didOpen` has no previous send record, so the client stamps it as "changed
 * now"; the #3736 staleness check read that stamp as a write after the
 * request, although no byte changed. The client here is the real
 * `createLSPClient` (the real stamp in `recordSentContent`), the tool and its
 * apply are the real ones, and only the `LSPService` shell around the client
 * is a double, as in tests/tools/lsp-navigation-rename-staleness.test.ts.
 *
 * State table (the file the rename edit also writes, `b.ts`, aged an hour so
 * the unopened mtime rule has nothing to say about it unless the test writes):
 *
 *  | b.ts before compute | after compute                    | expected |
 *  |---------------------|----------------------------------|----------|
 *  | opened              | nothing                          | applies  |
 *  | opened              | rewritten and re-synced          | refused  |
 *  | opened              | rewritten (old mtime), re-synced | refused  |
 *  | never opened        | nothing                          | applies  |
 *  | never opened        | first opened, bytes unchanged    | applies  |
 *  | written after client start (old mtime), first opened | refused |
 *  | written within the margin before client start, first opened | refused |
 *  | never opened        | rewritten, then first opened     | refused  |
 *  | never opened        | first opened, then rewritten+sync| refused  |
 *  | never opened        | first opened, then rewritten (old mtime), no sync | refused |
 *  | never opened        | first opened, then rewritten (old mtime), re-synced | refused |
