- A language server respawned after a crash, or back from a notify-stall
  demotion, is no longer treated as warm, or as known cold, because its
  predecessor was. Every client retirement now forgets both verdicts, and a
  touch or warm-up whose client was replaced while it waited no longer marks
  the replacement ready or caches it cold, so the workspace sweep warms the
  new server up instead of timing out on its first files or skipping them
  (closes #3502).
