- The orphan reaper no longer kills a process that merely reuses a dead
  session's recorded pid. It used to match a recorded LSP child by the base
  name of its command, so a live session's language server, a live pi-lens
  host (when the recorded command was `node`) or a user's own process on that
  pid could be killed, and a pid that changed hands between the sweep's check
  and its kill was killed too. Registry records now carry each child's and
  host's OS start time; a kill needs the same start as recorded, a record
  without one is never killed by pid, and the identity is checked again right
  before each signal. On Linux the start includes the boot id, so a record
  that survived a reboot never matches, and a session that cannot read this
  boot's id (an empty or bound-over `boot_id`) judges no start at all rather
  than taking every live owner for a reused pid. A session in another Linux
  time namespace reads the same start as everyone else, rather than one
  shifted by its boottime offset. A new session on a crashed
  session's pid no longer takes over its children. `instances.json` only
  gains fields, so older versions still read it (refs #3538).
