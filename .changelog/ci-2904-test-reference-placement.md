- **Recognise PR test references by shape and placement (refs #2904)** — Test IDs, test paths, citations, and titles are checked only where their Markdown placement identifies them as test evidence. Malformed pipe blocks remain visible Markdown, while valid tables retain column-specific filtering. Local body lint tolerates shallow or single-commit histories by requiring Test assessment when changed-file scope is unavailable.
