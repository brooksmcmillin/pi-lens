- **PHP LSP (intelephense) now installs (closes #2722)** — the managed installer verified every npm tool by spawning `--version`, and intelephense has no CLI: it prints ~4 MB of bundled source before the "connection input stream is not set" line that proves it is a healthy stdio server, and Node drops everything past 1 MiB of a piped stderr, so that proof never reached pi-lens and the installer deleted the package it had just installed — every time, since 2026-04-17. A managed npm server can now declare that it is verified from the installed tree instead (package manifest + entry module on disk, no spawn at all), which intelephense does; and for every tool still verified by spawning, a probe that ran out of readable output before it could decide now keeps the installation when the installed tree is intact (an incomplete tree is still cleaned up so the next install can repair it) instead of treating "cannot tell" as "broken".
