/**
 * The read guard across conversation moves (#3521): `/tree`, `/fork`,
 * `/clone`, resume and `pi --fork <path>`.
 *
 * A read record is evidence only while the conversation still shows the
 * agent the tool result it came from. pi keeps entry ids and tool-call ids
 * intact across `/tree`, `createBranchedSession` and `forkFrom`, and the
 * handler's `ctx.sessionManager.getBranch()` is the ground truth for what the
 * conversation now holds. So the rule is: keep a record exactly when its
 * `toolCallId` has a `toolResult` entry on that branch.
 *
 * Accepted residual (maintainer decision on #3521): pi stores provider
 * tool-call ids verbatim, and some providers reuse them across responses —
 * Mistral's fallback derives `toolcall:<index>`, OpenAI-compatible servers
 * may send index ids or none (`id || ""`), Google makes ids unique within one
 * message only. With those providers a sibling branch's read can match an id
 * that is also on this branch. An empty id is never recorded
 * (`resolveToolCallCorrelationId` returns undefined), so it never matches.
 *
 * The hand-off. pi re-runs the extension factory for every conversation move
 * except `/tree`, so the read-set crosses to the next activation as the
 * `read-guard` session store (#3612): the hand-off slot for an in-process
 * `/fork`, `/clone` or `/reload`, the sidecar for resume and `pi --fork`.
