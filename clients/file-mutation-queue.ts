/**
 * pi's per-file mutation queue, for pi-lens' own in-place writers (#3506).
 *
 * pi runs tool calls in parallel and serialises its built-in `edit` and
 * `write` through `withFileMutationQueue(path)`; its extension docs require a
 * file-mutating extension to join the same queue (`@earendil-works/
 * pi-coding-agent` `docs/extensions.md` ~1925). The helper is only exposed as
 * a package export, so the pi host adapter (`index.ts`) registers a lazy
 * `import()` of the package here, and every other host (the MCP adapter,
 * direct unit callers) runs the writers unqueued, as before.
 *
 * Which copy of the package that import reaches depends on how pi loaded
 * pi-lens. pi's loader hands `dist/index.js` to jiti, and jiti first imports
 * an ESM-typed `.js` NATIVELY. In an installed pi-lens that native import
 * fails, because `dist/index.js` statically imports `@earendil-works/pi-tui`,
 * which is not resolvable from the package; jiti then falls back to
 * transpiling, which rewrites `import()` to jiti's own import, and that is
 * what serves pi's running instance (`virtualModules` in the bundled CLI,
 * the dist aliases otherwise). Where pi-lens' static imports DO resolve
 * natively (a dev checkout, a project whose `node_modules` holds pi and
 * pi-tui), the native module's `import()` goes through Node's resolution and
 * can load a second copy of the SDK, whose queue does not serialise with pi's
 * edits. The lookup therefore checks the copy it got against the host's own
 * session manager (`noteHostSessionManager`) and records the outcome either
 * way.
