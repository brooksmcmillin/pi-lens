/**
 * Generic mutation-recording bridge for pi-lens (#2423).
 *
 * ## Trust model — explicitly advisory
 *
 * Sibling of `clients/read-bridge.ts` and it inherits that module's trust
 * model verbatim: any code sharing this Node.js process already has full access
 * to pi-lens's internal state, so the bridge is not a security boundary. What
 * it provides is a stable API surface, one place for flag and scope checks, and
 * defensive validation that catches integration bugs early.
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * `clients/mutating-tool.ts` classifies mutations pi-lens SEES as tool events.
 * A producer that writes a file some other way — a co-process extension with
 * its own registered tool, or pi-lens's own `ast_grep_replace` running
 * `--update-all` — is invisible to that path. It records the mutation here
 * instead, and the same downstream bookkeeping runs: read-guard staleness
 * stamp, turn-state modified ranges, an attributed change-log receipt, and a
 * DEFERRED autofix and format pass at `agent_settled`.
 *
 * Deferred, not immediate, is deliberate: a bulk rewrite usually touches many
 * files, and formatting each one as it lands fights the producer that is still
 * writing.
 *
 * Protocol (producer side)
 * ────────────────────────
 *
 *   const bridge = (globalThis as any)[Symbol.for("pi-lens:mutation-bridge")];
 *   bridge?.recordMutation({
 *     filePath,      // absolute path
 *     kind,          // "write" (whole file authored) or "edit" (part changed)
 *     touchedLines,  // optional [start, end], 1-based inclusive
 *     editRanges,    // optional [start, end][] for a scattered multi-range edit
 *     consumer,      // optional identifier, e.g. "my-extension"
 *   });
 *
 * Check `bridge.version` before calling. A bridge whose version you do not
 * recognize is unsupported. Calling before pi-lens is loaded, or when the guard
 * is disabled, is safe: the bridge is absent or the call is dropped.
 *
 * `recordMutation` returns `true` when pi-lens took the record and `false` when
 * it dropped it (malformed payload, out-of-scope path, or a bookkeeping error),
 * so a producer can count its own drops.
 *
 * Protocol (registration side, internal to pi-lens)
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `registerMutationBridge` is called once from the extension factory, next to
 * `registerReadBridge`, behind a module-level singleton guard so factory
 * re-activations do not mount a second bridge. Every dep is a GETTER resolved
 * at call time, so a replaced runtime or cache manager is picked up without
 * re-registration — the same live-getter discipline the read bridge uses.
