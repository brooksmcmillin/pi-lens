/**
 * Restore agent edits that a whole-package fixer run overwrote (#3598).
 *
 * `cargo clippy --fix` and `dart fix --apply` rewrite every fixable file of the
 * crate or package, but the pipeline's hold on pi's file-mutation queue covers
 * only the edit's own target (#3541, #3506). An agent edit to a SIBLING file
 * that lands while the tool runs is then erased by the tool's write, because
 * the tool read that file before the edit.
 *
 * Maintainer decision on #3598 (option 3, detect and restore; options 1 and 2
 * were rejected because queueing every crate file breaks the single lock
 * order and running on a copy needs a per-file apply):
 *
 * 1. Before the run, hash the files the tool can rewrite ({@link beginFixRun}).
 * 2. During the run, capture the bytes of any of those files pi-lens observes
 *    an agent mutate ({@link noteAgentMutation}, called from the tool_result
 *    seam and from the mutation bridge that observed-mutation replays through),
 *    and note the agent's mutating tool calls that are still in flight
 *    ({@link noteAgentCallStart} / {@link noteAgentCallEnd}).
 * 3. After the run, write the captured bytes back over the tool's write and
 *    record ONE degradation for the run ({@link FixRun.finish}).
 * 4. A file the tool created is not in the pre-run set and is left alone.
 * 5. An edit pi-lens cannot show survived is reported by file name, so the
 *    agent can re-apply it.
 *
 * ## The restore invariant (#3741 round 2, #3830)
 *
 * The restore never writes over content NEWER than the capture, and never
 * recreates a file that is absent at restore time. It writes only a file the
 * tool demonstrably rewrote after the capture. For each captured file, inside
 * pi's queue entry for it, the restore reads the file and decides:
 *
 * | at the restore                              | outcome                     |
 * | ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
 * | absent (agent deleted or renamed it)        | nothing; never recreated    |
 * | an agent call on it is still in flight      | not written; possibly lost  |
 * | bytes equal the capture                     | nothing                     |
 * | changed again before the write (re-read)    | not written; possibly lost  |
 * | otherwise (the tool rewrote it after)       | capture written back        |
 *
 * ## Lock order (#3830)
 *
 * The restore takes pi's queue entry for a sibling S, so an agent `edit` of S
 * cannot land between the restore's compare and its write. The pipeline holds
 * the target F's entry while the tool runs, through its own after-reads
 * (#3506), and the restore starts after the caller's scan of the tool's
 * changes, so it can wait for S's entry while F is held. That is safe because
 * nothing waits for the restore while it holds an entry:
 *
 * - A queue entry is requested by something that holds no other entry, with
 *   one exception: the multi-path LSP edit (`withHostFileMutationQueues`)
 *   requests its keys in ascending order.
 * - The restore holds one S entry at a time and does file I/O only inside it.
 * - {@link runWithFixRestore} returns the restore as a promise and awaits
 *   nothing on it. A caller awaits it only after it has released the target's
 *   hold, and the tool_result pipeline does not await it at all: F's
 *   diagnostics and blockers must not wait on whoever holds a sibling, so its
 *   loss notice goes to the agent through the advisory queue
 *   (`PipelineContext.onFixRunLoss`). A restore awaited INSIDE F's hold closes a cycle: an LSP edit of
 *   [S, F] holds S and waits for F, the pipeline holds F and waits for the
 *   restore, the restore waits for S (`formal/dispatch-pipeline`
 *   `SiblingRestoreQueuedInHold`, checked with CHECK_DEADLOCK;
 *   `tests/clients/fix-run-restore.test.ts` runs the same cycle through pi's
 *   real queue).
 *
 * The run stays registered until the restore ends, so an agent call that
 * starts after the tool exited is tracked (in flight, then captured) and the
 * restore does not write over it.
 *
 * ## What the capture can prove
 *
 * A native `write` or `edit` says what it wrote, so the capture is checked
 * against it, with line endings normalised (pi's edit tool matches in LF and
 * writes the file back in its own): a `write`'s whole content, or per edit the
 * `newText` that must be present and the `oldText` that must be gone. A
 * mismatch means the tool overwrote the edit before it was read: LOST. A
 * capture that nothing can check (a bridged, observed or bash producer, or an
 * edit with neither a `newText` nor a removable `oldText`) is reported as
 * POSSIBLY lost, never silently accepted: pi-lens cannot tell whether the tool
 * wrote between the agent's write and its read.
 *
 * ## The set is bounded to what the tool can rewrite
 *
 * The caller passes the project walk it already took for its changed-file diff
 * (ignored and vendor directories excluded, capped at its scan limit). This
 * module keeps only the files with the tool's source extension (`.rs`,
 * `.dart`), skips any file over {@link FIX_RUN_MAX_FILE_BYTES}, and stops
 * hashing at {@link FIX_RUN_HASH_BYTE_BUDGET}; a cut set is recorded, never
 * silent, and every run records its files, bytes and milliseconds.
 *
 * ## Residual, stated
 *
 * - The write is guarded by pi's queue and a content re-read; a writer outside
 *   the queue (bash, a bridged producer) that lands between the re-read and
 *   the rename is still overwritten.
 * - "In flight" is known only for calls that pass pi-lens's tool_call seam with
 *   a correlation id while a run is registered; a call made before
 *   `beginFixRun` is not seen (#3830, window D). A bash or bridged producer
 *   whose write lands during the run and whose bytes were never captured, on a
 *   file the tool did not touch, is neither seen nor restored over when no
 *   capture exists for the file; on a file the tool DID touch it is the
 *   unverifiable case above. A later capture replaces an earlier one (#3830,
 *   window C), and a file with no capture is skipped before the in-flight
 *   check (window B).
