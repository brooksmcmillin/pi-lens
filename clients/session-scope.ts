/**
 * Session scopes and the lineage handle (#3611, slice S1 of the #3609 design).
 *
 * pi re-runs the extension factory on every session transition except
 * `/tree`, and may re-evaluate the entry module on `/reload`, so the one
 * `RuntimeCoordinator` an evaluation holds cannot tell its sessions apart by
 * a per-instance counter: two evaluations' counters both start at 0 (N4), and
 * a per-evaluation order turn restarts while the widget's write guards, a
 * `clients/` module, keep their tokens (N3).
 *
 * The identity rule: **a lineage is a scope ticket, drawn from one process
 * counter when a scope begins. A handle is current while its scope is live
 * (session level) and, at branch level, while the scope's branch epoch equals
 * the one it captured.** A scope stops being live at its `session_shutdown`
 * or when its coordinator begins the next scope, and never becomes live
 * again. No session id, file or evaluation ordinal takes part in currency.
 *
 * The model is `formal/session-lifecycle/` (S9): tickets are its scope ids,
 * {@link retireScope} is its `Retire`, {@link moveBranch} its `Tree` epoch
 * bump, {@link nextOrderTurn} its `processOrderTurn`, and
 * {@link recordDroppedRead} its `recordDrop`.
 *
 * Handles hold their scope record by reference, so a retired scope needs no
 * registry lookup, and the process singleton holds two counters and nothing
 * that grows.
