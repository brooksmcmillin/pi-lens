/**
 * pi-lens-analyze — the *push* half of the mirror, in two modes.
 *
 * Per-edit (default): a Claude Code PostToolUse hook (matched to Edit|Write)
 * that fires pi-lens automatically after every edit, the way pi's per-edit
 * pipeline does. Also usable as a plain CLI for testing/debugging. Reuses the
 * Tier 1 `analyzeFile` facade and defaults to `no-lsp` so inline feedback is
 * FAST (cold LSP would cost ~5s per edit and under-report anyway — pull
 * `pilens_analyze` against the warm MCP server for the type-check). The fast
 * runners (tree-sitter structural, ast-grep security, biome/ruff/oxlint lint,
 * complexity) are complete even in a cold process.
 *
 * Per-turn (`--turn-end`, or a Claude Code `Stop` payload on stdin): the
 * analogue of pi's agent_end — incremental knip/madge, cascade-to-dependents,
 * tests, actionable-warnings aggregation. WARM-ONLY: it drives the real
 * `handleTurnEnd` inside the running MCP server over the workspace IPC socket
 * and never falls back to a cold pass, because only the warm process owns the
 * session state and pending turn work. A skip reports WHY, on stdout as well as
 * stderr (#1272 — Claude Code never surfaces stderr from a hook that exits 0,
 * so a stderr-only skip was indistinguishable from a clean turn), and records
 * the outcome for `pilens_health`.
 *
 * Input: `--file=<path>` (+ optional `--cwd=`), or a Claude Code hook JSON
 * payload on stdin (`tool_input.path`/`file_path`, `cwd`, `hook_event_name`).
 * argv wins: when `--file` or `--turn-end` is present stdin is never read at
 * all, so an open-but-idle pipe cannot hang the hook (#1271).
 * Output: a concise report on stdout; with `--hook`, a PostToolUse JSON
 * envelope that injects the report as context. Hooks exit 0 (advisory); plain
 * CLI failures exit 2. Clean scans and findings still exit 0.
