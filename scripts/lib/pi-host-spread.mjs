/**
 * Pure core of the certified-host tier spread (#4632 acceptance 9): WHICH
 * hosts to probe, WHERE each one is installed, what one per-host line says,
 * and what the run's exit code is.
 *
 * This module spawns nothing. `scripts/probe-pi-host-tiers.mjs` supplies the
 * one child process (a Vitest run of the tier contract suites against one
 * host), exactly as `scripts/release-qa.mjs` keeps its pure core out of the
 * spawning path so `tests/scripts/release-qa.test.ts` can hold it.
 *
 * THE CERTIFIED LIST HAS ONE OWNER: the `### Verified hosts` table in
 * `docs/release-qa-baseline.md`. `tests/packaging.test.ts` ties that table to
 * `PI_HOST_SUPPORTED_RANGE`, so the table is already the set a host claim may
 * name. The parser lives here and both readers import it, because a second
 * copy of "which rows count as verified" is how the spread and the packaging
 * ratchet would drift apart.
 *
 * TWO FAIL-CLOSED RULES, both learned from enumerated detectors (AGENTS.md
 * shape 69):
 *
 * 1. A row the reader cannot parse is a host the spread would silently skip,
 *    so it is returned as `unparseable` and the caller refuses the run rather
 *    than probing the hosts it happened to understand.
 * 2. An argument the parser does not recognize refuses the run. A probe that
 *    ignores a flag it was never taught prints a partial spread in the shape of
 *    a full one, which is the failure a hand-typed flag makes once.
