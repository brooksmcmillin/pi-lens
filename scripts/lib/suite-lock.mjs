/**
 * scripts/lib/suite-lock.mjs
 *
 * Core lock primitives for the machine-wide test-suite lock (#1101), used by
 * scripts/with-test-lock.mjs. Named to avoid the repo's `test-*.mjs`
 * .gitignore pattern (reserved for ephemeral scratch fixtures) — kept in
 * its own importable module (rather than inline in with-test-lock.mjs) so a
 * unit test can exercise acquire/release/contention/stale-takeover directly,
 * with short poll intervals, without spawning a real process tree.
 *
 * Pattern mirrors clients/installer/index.ts's `.install.lock`
 * (acquireInstallLock / isProcessAlive): atomic create via
 * fs.open(path, "wx"), owner JSON body `{ pid, startedIso }`, and "stale once
 * the recorded PID is confirmed dead" takeover. This is a minimal standalone
 * re-implementation (not an import of clients/installer/index.ts) because
 * scripts/ must run as plain .mjs before `npm run build` compiles
 * clients/*.ts to clients/*.js — see that file for the original if the two
 * ever need to be reconciled. ONE deliberate divergence from that original:
 * `.install.lock` ALSO ages out a lock with a still-live, readable PID once
 * it exceeds the owner's install bound + slack (#946 F1's PID-recycle
 * defense — an install has a known bounded duration to size that against).
 * This lock does NOT do that (see point 5 below) — a test-suite run has no
 * such bound.
 *
 * OS-agnosticism, explicitly:
 *  1. Locking is done ONLY via atomic file create (`fs.open(path, "wx")`),
 *     which is atomic on both POSIX and Windows filesystems — no
 *     flock/fcntl/byte-range lock APIs, which differ across OSes and don't
 *     exist uniformly on Windows.
 *  2. PID liveness is `process.kill(pid, 0)`; EPERM is treated as ALIVE
 *     (Windows returns EPERM, not ESRCH, for some protected-but-live
 *     processes), so only ESRCH (or any non-EPERM error) is treated as dead.
 *  3. Correctness never depends on the release handler running: a hard kill
 *     (Windows `taskkill /F`, POSIX SIGKILL) skips both the `finally` in
 *     with-test-lock.mjs and the best-effort `process.once("exit", ...)`
 *     cleanup below. The stale-after-PID-dead takeover below is the actual
 *     recovery path and is covered by a dedicated test ("lockfile exists,
 *     recorded PID dead -> immediate takeover", no age/timeout wait needed).
 *  4. Windows can transiently hold a file open (AV scanners, search
 *     indexer) so unlinks can fail with EBUSY/EPERM even when no other
 *     pi-lens process is involved. Both stale-takeover removal and release
 *     retry the unlink a few times with a short backoff before giving up
 *     (and logging if they ultimately fail — the next waiter's stale check
 *     still recovers it). A momentarily-unreadable-but-present lock file
 *     during acquire is treated as CONTENDED (wait/retry), never as a crash.
 *  5. The lock body records `{ pid, startedIso }` (an ISO-8601 string, not
 *     just an epoch number) so heartbeat/timeout messages are human-legible
 *     ("held by PID <pid> since <startedIso>") for exactly this diagnosis:
 *     unlike `.install.lock`, this lock has NO age-expiry path for a lock
 *     whose recorded PID still reads as alive — deliberately, since a
 *     full-suite run has no bounded duration for a timeout to be sized
 *     against, and the owner never touches the lock file's mtime while
 *     holding it (so an mtime-based bound would just be a second arbitrary
 *     guess). The consequence: if the OS recycles a dead PID for an
 *     unrelated live process before a waiter re-checks, that waiter treats
 *     the lock as still (wrongly) held and WAITS FOREVER — recoverable only
 *     by a human reading the heartbeat's pid+startedIso and deleting the
 *     lock file by hand. This is strictly worse than the installer's
 *     bounded wait for that one PID-recycle case, traded deliberately for
 *     never taking over a run that is still genuinely in progress. Possible
 *     future hardening: have the owner periodically touch the lock file's
 *     mtime while still running, so a waiter could safely distinguish
 *     "stale mtime + dead-looking PID" from "recycled PID, still running" —
 *     not implemented here.
 *  6. Paths go through `os.homedir()` / `path.join()` throughout, never
 *     hand-built strings. Tests pass an explicit `lockPath` under a
 *     `fs.mkdtemp()` directory (or set `PI_LENS_HOME` to one) so they never
 *     touch the developer's real `~/.pi-lens`, and behavior doesn't depend
 *     on path casing or separator conventions.
