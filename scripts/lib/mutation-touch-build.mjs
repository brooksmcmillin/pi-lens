/**
 * buildCommand replacement for the compiled-source mutation lane (#3531).
 *
 * Stryker's DisableTypeChecksPreprocessor rewrites every project `.ts` file
 * in place (inserting `@ts-nocheck`) during sandbox init, before the dry
 * run -- which bumps their mtime above the already-built `.js` the driver
 * compiled before invoking Stryker at all. `tests/support/check-build-
 * freshness.ts`'s globalSetup then aborts the dry run as a "stale build"
 * (measured: 2026-09-26, `clients/config-core/deny.ts` 16ms newer than its
 * `.js` after a scripts-only `--mutate` run touched no compiled source).
 *
 * A real rebuild here (the scripts-only lane's plain `npm run build`) would
 * fix that, but it would also overwrite the instrumented (mutation-switch-
 * embedded) `.js` Stryker just wrote in place for a compiled mutate target,
 * silently discarding every mutant before a single test runs -- content
 * Stryker itself never wrote back (#3531 issue: "never let a post-instrument
 * build clobber the mutants"). This only bumps mtimes; it never reads or
 * rewrites file content, so it cannot touch the instrumented switches.
