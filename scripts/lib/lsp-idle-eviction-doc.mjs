// without spawning a language server. The measurement itself lives in
// lsp-idle-eviction-probe.mjs; the script that drives both is
// scripts/measure-lsp-idle-eviction.mjs.
//
// Why the committed document carries only STABLE columns (result, reason,
// respawn, coverage): a nightly refresh PR opens whenever the document changes
// by anything but its date (`compareGeneratedDocs`), and every timing or memory
// figure differs on every run, bucketed or not (review round 1 F1: two
// back-to-back local runs flipped 7 of 30 bucket cells). The figures are
// evidence, not diff noise, so they go to the run's step log, its job summary
// and the JSON summary.
